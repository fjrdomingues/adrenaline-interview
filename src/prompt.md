How can you ensure that state is updated immutably when filtering out data?

# Answer - Answer given to the user
### Updating State Immutably when Filtering Data:
When filtering out data from an array in React state, it's important to update the state immutably to ensure that React detects the change and triggers re-renders correctly. Here's how you can ensure that the state is updated immutably when filtering out data:

1. **Using the Spread Operator**:
   - Create a new array by spreading the existing data array and filtering out the data to be removed.
   - Set the state with the new array to maintain immutability.

   ```javascript
   function handleDeleteComments(commentId) {
     const updatedData = data.filter((comment) => comment.id !== commentId);
     setData([...updatedData]);
   }
   ```

2. **Using Array.prototype.slice()**:
   - Use `slice()` to create a shallow copy of the data array and then filter out the data.
   - Set the state with the new array to ensure immutability.

   ```javascript
   function handleDeleteComments(commentId) {
     const updatedData = data.slice().filter((comment) => comment.id !== commentId);
     setData(updatedData);
   }
   ```

3. **Using Array.prototype.filter() with Object Spread**:
   - If the data structure is more complex (e.g., nested objects), you can use object spread to maintain immutability.

   ```javascript
   function handleDeleteComments(commentId) {
     const updatedData = data.map((comment) => {
       if (comment.id !== commentId) {
         return { ...comment };
       }
     }).filter(Boolean); // Filter out undefined values
     setData(updatedData);
   }
   ```

By following these approaches and ensuring that the state is updated immutably when filtering out data, you can maintain the integrity of the React state and trigger re-renders effectively.

# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen
Diagram Type: flowchart
Reasoning: The answer describes a process with sequential steps on how to update state immutably when filtering out data. A flowchart is suitable for illustrating these steps and decision points, such as choosing between different methods (Spread Operator, slice(), filter() with Object Spread) for updating the state. It can visually represent the flow of operations, making it easier to understand the sequence of actions and decisions involved in the process.

# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram

Flowcharts are composed of **nodes** (geometric shapes) and **edges** (arrows or lines). The Mermaid code defines how nodes and edges are made and accommodates different arrow types, multi-directional arrows, and any linking to and from subgraphs.

```warning
If you are using the word "end" in a Flowchart node, capitalize the entire word or any of the letters (e.g., "End" or "END"), or apply this [workaround](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/1444#issuecomment-639528897). Typing "end" in all lowercase letters will break the Flowchart.
```

```warning
If you are using the letter "o" or "x" as the first letter in a connecting Flowchart node, add a space before the letter or capitalize the letter (e.g., "dev--- ops", "dev---Ops").

Typing "A---oB" will create a [circle edge](#circle-edge-example).

Typing "A---xB" will create a [cross edge](#cross-edge-example).
```

### A node (default)

```mermaid-example
---
title: Node
---
flowchart LR
    id
```

```note
The id is what is displayed in the box.
```

```tip
Instead of `flowchart` one can also use `graph`.
```

### A node with text

It is also possible to set text in the box that differs from the id. If this is done several times, it is the last text
found for the node that will be used. Also if you define edges for the node later on, you can omit text definitions. The
one previously defined will be used when rendering the box.

```mermaid-example
---
title: Node with text
---
flowchart LR
    id1[This is the text in the box]
```

#### Unicode text

Use `"` to enclose the unicode text.

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id["This ❤ Unicode"]
```

#### Markdown formatting

Use double quotes and backticks "\` text \`" to enclose the markdown text.

```mermaid-example
%%{init: {"flowchart": {"htmlLabels": false}} }%%
flowchart LR
    markdown["`This **is** _Markdown_`"]
    newLines["`Line1
    Line 2
    Line 3`"]
    markdown --> newLines
```

### Direction

This statement declares the direction of the Flowchart.

This declares the flowchart is oriented from top to bottom (`TD` or `TB`).

```mermaid-example
flowchart TD
    Start --> Stop
```

This declares the flowchart is oriented from left to right (`LR`).

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    Start --> Stop
```

Possible FlowChart orientations are:

- TB - Top to bottom
- TD - Top-down/ same as top to bottom
- BT - Bottom to top
- RL - Right to left
- LR - Left to right

## Node shapes

### A node with round edges

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id1(This is the text in the box)
```

### A stadium-shaped node

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id1([This is the text in the box])
```

### A node in a subroutine shape

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id1[[This is the text in the box]]
```

### A node in a cylindrical shape

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id1[(Database)]
```

### A node in the form of a circle

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id1((This is the text in the circle))
```

### A node in an asymmetric shape

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id1>This is the text in the box]
```

Currently only the shape above is possible and not its mirror. _This might change with future releases._

### A node (rhombus)

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id1{This is the text in the box}
```

### A hexagon node

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id1{{This is the text in the box}}
```

### Parallelogram

```mermaid-example
flowchart TD
    id1[/This is the text in the box/]
```

### Parallelogram alt

```mermaid-example
flowchart TD
    id1[\This is the text in the box\]
```

### Trapezoid

```mermaid-example
flowchart TD
    A[/Christmas\]
```

### Trapezoid alt

```mermaid-example
flowchart TD
    B[\Go shopping/]
```

### Double circle

```mermaid-example
flowchart TD
    id1(((This is the text in the circle)))
```

## Links between nodes

Nodes can be connected with links/edges. It is possible to have different types of links or attach a text string to a link.

### A link with arrow head

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A-->B
```

### An open link

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A --- B
```

### Text on links

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A-- This is the text! ---B
```

or

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A---|This is the text|B
```

### A link with arrow head and text

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A-->|text|B
```

or

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A-- text -->B
```

### Dotted link

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
   A-.->B;
```

### Dotted link with text

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
   A-. text .-> B
```

### Thick link

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
   A ==> B
```

### Thick link with text

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
   A == text ==> B
```

### An invisible link

This can be a useful tool in some instances where you want to alter the default positioning of a node.

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A ~~~ B
```

### Chaining of links

It is possible declare many links in the same line as per below:

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
   A -- text --> B -- text2 --> C
```

It is also possible to declare multiple nodes links in the same line as per below:

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
   a --> b & c--> d
```

You can then describe dependencies in a very expressive way. Like the one-liner below:

```mermaid-example
flowchart TB
    A & B--> C & D
```

If you describe the same diagram using the basic syntax, it will take four lines. A
word of warning, one could go overboard with this making the flowchart harder to read in
markdown form. The Swedish word `lagom` comes to mind. It means, not too much and not too little.
This goes for expressive syntaxes as well.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A --> C
    A --> D
    B --> C
    B --> D
```

## New arrow types

There are new types of arrows supported:

- circle edge
- cross edge

### Circle edge example

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A --o B
```

### Cross edge example

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A --x B
```

## Multi directional arrows

There is the possibility to use multidirectional arrows.

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A o--o B
    B <--> C
    C x--x D
```

### Minimum length of a link

Each node in the flowchart is ultimately assigned to a rank in the rendered
graph, i.e. to a vertical or horizontal level (depending on the flowchart
orientation), based on the nodes to which it is linked. By default, links
can span any number of ranks, but you can ask for any link to be longer
than the others by adding extra dashes in the link definition.

In the following example, two extra dashes are added in the link from node _B_
to node _E_, so that it spans two more ranks than regular links:

```mermaid-example
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is it?}
    B -->|Yes| C[OK]
    C --> D[Rethink]
    D --> B
    B ---->|No| E[End]
```

> **Note** Links may still be made longer than the requested number of ranks
> by the rendering engine to accommodate other requests.

When the link label is written in the middle of the link, the extra dashes must
be added on the right side of the link. The following example is equivalent to
the previous one:

```mermaid-example
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is it?}
    B -- Yes --> C[OK]
    C --> D[Rethink]
    D --> B
    B -- No ----> E[End]
```

For dotted or thick links, the characters to add are equals signs or dots,
as summed up in the following table:

| Length            |   1    |    2    |    3     |
| ----------------- | :----: | :-----: | :------: |
| Normal            | `---`  | `----`  | `-----`  |
| Normal with arrow | `-->`  | `--->`  | `---->`  |
| Thick             | `===`  | `====`  | `=====`  |
| Thick with arrow  | `==>`  | `===>`  | `====>`  |
| Dotted            | `-.-`  | `-..-`  | `-...-`  |
| Dotted with arrow | `-.->` | `-..->` | `-...->` |

## Special characters that break syntax

It is possible to put text within quotes in order to render more troublesome characters. As in the example below:

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    id1["This is the (text) in the box"]
```

### Entity codes to escape characters

It is possible to escape characters using the syntax exemplified here.

```mermaid-example
    flowchart LR
        A["A double quote:#quot;"] --> B["A dec char:#9829;"]
```

Numbers given are base 10, so `#` can be encoded as `#35;`. It is also supported to use HTML character names.

## Subgraphs

```
subgraph title
    graph definition
end
```

An example below:

```mermaid-example
flowchart TB
    c1-->a2
    subgraph one
    a1-->a2
    end
    subgraph two
    b1-->b2
    end
    subgraph three
    c1-->c2
    end
```

You can also set an explicit id for the subgraph.

```mermaid-example
flowchart TB
    c1-->a2
    subgraph ide1 [one]
    a1-->a2
    end
```

### flowcharts

With the graphtype flowchart it is also possible to set edges to and from subgraphs as in the flowchart below.

```mermaid-example
flowchart TB
    c1-->a2
    subgraph one
    a1-->a2
    end
    subgraph two
    b1-->b2
    end
    subgraph three
    c1-->c2
    end
    one --> two
    three --> two
    two --> c2
```

### Direction in subgraphs

With the graphtype flowcharts you can use the direction statement to set the direction which the subgraph will render like in this example.

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
  subgraph TOP
    direction TB
    subgraph B1
        direction RL
        i1 -->f1
    end
    subgraph B2
        direction BT
        i2 -->f2
    end
  end
  A --> TOP --> B
  B1 --> B2
```

#### Limitation

If any of a subgraph's nodes are linked to the outside, subgraph direction will be ignored. Instead the subgraph will inherit the direction of the parent graph:

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    subgraph subgraph1
        direction TB
        top1[top] --> bottom1[bottom]
    end
    subgraph subgraph2
        direction TB
        top2[top] --> bottom2[bottom]
    end
    %% ^ These subgraphs are identical, except for the links to them:

    %% Link *to* subgraph1: subgraph1 direction is maintained
    outside --> subgraph1
    %% Link *within* subgraph2:
    %% subgraph2 inherits the direction of the top-level graph (LR)
    outside ---> top2
```

## Markdown Strings

The "Markdown Strings" feature enhances flowcharts and mind maps by offering a more versatile string type, which supports text formatting options such as bold and italics, and automatically wraps text within labels.

```mermaid-example
%%{init: {"flowchart": {"htmlLabels": false}} }%%
flowchart LR
subgraph "One"
  a("`The **cat**
  in the hat`") -- "edge label" --> b{{"`The **dog** in the hog`"}}
end
subgraph "`**Two**`"
  c("`The **cat**
  in the hat`") -- "`Bold **edge label**`" --> d("The dog in the hog")
end
```

Formatting:

- For bold text, use double asterisks (`**`) before and after the text.
- For italics, use single asterisks (`*`) before and after the text.
- With traditional strings, you needed to add `<br>` tags for text to wrap in nodes. However, markdown strings automatically wrap text when it becomes too long and allows you to start a new line by simply using a newline character instead of a `<br>` tag.

This feature is applicable to node labels, edge labels, and subgraph labels.

## Interaction

It is possible to bind a click event to a node, the click can lead to either a javascript callback or to a link which will be opened in a new browser tab.

```note
This functionality is disabled when using `securityLevel='strict'` and enabled when using `securityLevel='loose'`.
```

```
click nodeId callback
click nodeId call callback()
```

- nodeId is the id of the node
- callback is the name of a javascript function defined on the page displaying the graph, the function will be called with the nodeId as parameter.

Examples of tooltip usage below:

```html
<script>
  const callback = function () {
    alert('A callback was triggered');
  };
</script>
```

The tooltip text is surrounded in double quotes. The styles of the tooltip are set by the class `.mermaidTooltip`.

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A-->B
    B-->C
    C-->D
    click A callback "Tooltip for a callback"
    click B "https://www.github.com" "This is a tooltip for a link"
    click C call callback() "Tooltip for a callback"
    click D href "https://www.github.com" "This is a tooltip for a link"
```

> **Success** The tooltip functionality and the ability to link to urls are available from version 0.5.2.

?> Due to limitations with how Docsify handles JavaScript callback functions, an alternate working demo for the above code can be viewed at [this jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/Ogglas/2o73vdez/7).

Links are opened in the same browser tab/window by default. It is possible to change this by adding a link target to the click definition (`_self`, `_blank`, `_parent` and `_top` are supported):

```mermaid-example
flowchart LR
    A-->B
    B-->C
    C-->D
    D-->E
    click A "https://www.github.com" _blank
    click B "https://www.github.com" "Open this in a new tab" _blank
    click C href "https://www.github.com" _blank
    click D href "https://www.github.com" "Open this in a new tab" _blank
```

Beginner's tip—a full example using interactive links in a html context:

```html
<body>
  <pre class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR
        A-->B
        B-->C
        C-->D
        click A callback "Tooltip"
        click B "https://www.github.com" "This is a link"
        click C call callback() "Tooltip"
        click D href "https://www.github.com" "This is a link"
  </pre>

  <script>
    const callback = function () {
      alert('A callback was triggered');
    };
    const config = {
      startOnLoad: true,
      flowchart: { useMaxWidth: true, htmlLabels: true, curve: 'cardinal' },
      securityLevel: 'loose',
    };
    mermaid.initialize(config);
  </script>
</body>
```

### Comments

Comments can be entered within a flow diagram, which will be ignored by the parser. Comments need to be on their own line, and must be prefaced with `%%` (double percent signs). Any text after the start of the comment to the next newline will be treated as a comment, including any flow syntax

```mermaid
flowchart LR
%% this is a comment A -- text --> B{node}
   A -- text --> B -- text2 --> C
```
