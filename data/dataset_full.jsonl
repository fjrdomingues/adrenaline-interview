Modify the necessary variables in the Java code to match your IBM MQ configuration:\n   - Host name or IP address\n   - Listener port for your queue manager\n   - Channel name\n   - Queue manager name\n   - User name that application uses to connect to MQ\n   - Password that the application uses to connect to MQ\n   - Queue name that the application uses to put and get messages to and from\n\n2. Add the following code snippet to set the SSL cipher suite in your Java code:\n   ```java\n   cf.setStringProperty(WMQConstants.WMQ_SSL_CIPHER_SUITE, \"*TLS12\");\n   ```\n\n3.

Let's ensure that the `count` value is correctly set and updated in the component and Redux state:\n\n1. **Component Update Logic**:\n   - When the component mounts, ensure that the `count` value is initialized with the correct value from the Redux state.\n   - When the `select` element's value changes, make sure the `count` state is updated using `setCount` with the selected number.\n\n2. **Redux State Update**:\n   - Confirm that the `updateNum` action is dispatched correctly with the selected number.\n   - Check if the `updateNum` action updates the `count` value in the Redux state as expected.\n\n3. **Troubleshooting Steps**:\n   - Add `console.log` statements in the component to track the `count` value changes and ensure it reflects the selected number.\n   - Verify that the `updateNum` action is dispatched with the correct values when the `select` element value changes.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue further:\n\n- **Component Initialization**:\n  - Add a `console.log` statement to check the initial value of `count` in the component when it mounts.\n\n- **Dispatch Action**:\n  - Add a `console.log` statement inside the `updateNum` action to see if it receives the correct value when dispatched.\n\n- **Redux State Update**:\n  - Check the Redux DevTools to see if the `count` value is updated in the Redux state when the `updateNum` action is dispatched.\n\nBy following these steps and checking the component initialization, action dispatch, and Redux state update, you should be able to identify where the issue lies and correct it to ensure the `count` value persists correctly even after a page refresh.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The provided code and explanation revolve around the interactions between components and Redux actions, focusing on the sequence of operations like initializing, updating, and dispatching actions. A sequence diagram is best suited to represent these interactions and the order in which they occur, illustrating how the system components communicate over time to manage the cart state, including adding to cart, removing from cart, and updating the count. This diagram type effectively captures the dynamic behavior and sequence of events in the system.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page.

A state diagram is suitable for illustrating these states and the transitions between them, highlighting how different issues can arise and potentially resolve in the context of mutex usage.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> \"A state diagram is a type of diagram used in computer science and related fields to describe the behavior of systems.\n> State diagrams require that the system described is composed of a finite number of states; sometimes, this is indeed the\n> case, while at other times this is a reasonable abstraction.\" Wikipedia\n\nMermaid can render state diagrams.

You start in the\n**Still** state. From **Still** you can change to the **Moving** state. From **Moving** you can change either back to the **Still** state or to\nthe **Crash** state. There is no transition from **Still** to **Crash**. (You can't crash if you're still.)\n\n## States\n\nA state can be declared in multiple ways. The simplest way is to define a state with just an id:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    stateId\n```\n\nAnother way is by using the state keyword with a description as per below:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    state \"This is a state description\" as s2\n```\n\nAnother way to define a state with a description is to define the state id followed by a colon and the description:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s2 : This is a state description\n```\n\n## Transitions\n\nTransitions are path/edges when one state passes into another. This is represented using text arrow, \"\\-\\-\\>\".\n\nWhen you define a transition between two states and the states are not already defined, the undefined states are defined\nwith the id from the transition. You can later add descriptions to states defined this way.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s1 --> s2\n```\n\nIt is possible to add text to a transition to describe what it represents:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s1 --> s2: A transition\n```\n\n## Start and End\n\nThere are two special states indicating the start and stop of the diagram. These are written with the [\\*] syntax and\nthe direction of the transition to it defines it either as a start or a stop state.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> s1\n    s1 --> [*]\n```\n\n## Composite states\n\nIn a real world use of state diagrams you often end up with diagrams that are multidimensional as one state can\nhave several internal states. These are called composite states in this terminology.\n\nIn order to define a composite state you need to use the state keyword followed by an id and the body of the composite\nstate between \\{\\}. See the example below:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n    state First {\n        [*] --> second\n        second --> [*]\n    }\n```\n\nYou can do this in several layers:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n\n    state First {\n        [*] --> Second\n\n        state Second {\n            [*] --> second\n            second --> Third\n\n            state Third {\n                [*] --> third\n                third --> [*]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nYou can also define transitions also between composite states:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n    First --> Second\n    First --> Third\n\n    state First {\n        [*] --> fir\n        fir --> [*]\n    }\n    state Second {\n        [*] --> sec\n        sec --> [*]\n    }\n    state Third {\n        [*] --> thi\n        thi --> [*]\n    }\n```\n\n_You can not define transitions between internal states belonging to different composite states_\n\n## Choice\n\nSometimes you need to model a choice between two or more paths, you can do so using &lt;&lt;choice&gt;&gt;.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    state if_state <<choice>>\n    [*] --> IsPositive\n    IsPositive --> if_state\n    if_state --> False: if n < 0\n    if_state --> True : if n >= 0\n```\n\n## Forks\n\nIt is possible to specify a fork in the diagram using &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;join&gt;&gt;.\n\n```mermaid-example\n   stateDiagram-v2\n    state fork_state <<fork>>\n      [*] --> fork_state\n      fork_state --> State2\n      fork_state --> State3\n\n      state join_state <<join>>\n      State2 --> join_state\n      State3 --> join_state\n      join_state --> State4\n      State4 --> [*]\n```\n\n## Notes\n\nSometimes nothing says it better than a Post-it note. That is also the case in state diagrams.\n\nHere you can choose to put the note to the _right of_ or to the _left of_ a node.\n\n```mermaid-example\n    stateDiagram-v2\n        State1: The state with a note\n        note right of State1\n            Important information! You can write\n            notes.\n        end note\n        State1 --> State2\n        note left of State2 : This is the note to the left.\n```\n\n## Concurrency\n\nAs in plantUml you can specify concurrency using the -- symbol.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Active\n\n    state Active {\n        [*] --> NumLockOff\n        NumLockOff --> NumLockOn : EvNumLockPressed\n        NumLockOn --> NumLockOff : EvNumLockPressed\n        --\n        [*] --> CapsLockOff\n        CapsLockOff --> CapsLockOn : EvCapsLockPressed\n        CapsLockOn --> CapsLockOff : EvCapsLockPressed\n        --\n        [*] --> ScrollLockOff\n        ScrollLockOff --> ScrollLockOn : EvScrollLockPressed\n        ScrollLockOn --> ScrollLockOff : EvScrollLockPressed\n    }\n```\n\n## Setting the direction of the diagram\n\nWith state diagrams you can use the direction statement to set the direction which the diagram will render like in this\nexample.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram\n    direction LR\n    [*] --> A\n    A --> B\n    B --> C\n    state B {\n      direction LR\n      a --> b\n    }\n    B --> D\n```\n\n## Comments\n\nComments can be entered within a state diagram chart, which will be ignored by the parser. Comments need to be on their\nown line, and must be prefaced with `%%` (double percent signs). Any text after the start of the comment to the next\nnewline will be treated as a comment, including any diagram syntax\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Still\n    Still --> [*]\n%% this is a comment\n    Still --> Moving\n    Moving --> Still %% another comment\n    Moving --> Crash\n    Crash --> [*]\n```\n\n\n# Your output"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> NormalOperation: Start\n    NormalOperation --> Deadlock: Mutexes not released properly or circular dependency\n    NormalOperation --> PriorityInversion: Low-priority task holds mutex needed by high-priority task\n    NormalOperation --> Starvation: Thread preempted before acquiring mutex\n    NormalOperation --> PerformanceIssues: Overuse of mutexes\n    NormalOperation --> RaceConditions: Improper use of mutexes\n    NormalOperation --> ResourceLeakOrDeadlock: Forgetting to unlock mutex\n    Deadlock --> Resolution: Resolve deadlock\n    PriorityInversion --> Resolution: Resolve priority inversion\n    Starvation --> Resolution: Resolve starvation\n    PerformanceIssues --> NormalOperation: Optimize mutex usage\n    RaceConditions --> NormalOperation: Correct mutex usage\n    ResourceLeakOrDeadlock --> NormalOperation: Ensure mutexes are unlocked\n    Resolution --> NormalOperation: Back to normal operation\n    Deadlock --> [*]\n    PriorityInversion --> [*]\n    Starvation --> [*]\n    RaceConditions --> [*]\n    ResourceLeakOrDeadlock --> [*]\n```"}]}

Here are some key points about mutexes based on the information provided:\n\n- A mutex allows only one thread to lock and own it at a time.\n- It is used to prevent race conditions where multiple threads access shared data concurrently.\n- When a thread locks a mutex, it becomes the owner and can access the protected resources.\n- If another thread tries to lock the mutex while it is already locked, the requesting thread will be suspended and queued until the mutex is unlocked.\n- Mutexes are commonly used to protect critical sections of code where shared data is accessed and modified by multiple threads.\n\nIf you need more specific information or code examples, please let me know!\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: stateDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation of a mutex involves describing its states (locked, unlocked) and the transitions between these states based on actions taken by threads (locking, unlocking). A state diagram is well-suited to represent these concepts because it can clearly illustrate the different states a mutex can be in and how it transitions between these states depending on the actions of threads. This makes it easier to understand the behavior of mutexes in concurrent programming.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> \"A state diagram is a type of diagram used in computer science and related fields to describe the behavior of systems.\n> State diagrams require that the system described is composed of a finite number of states; sometimes, this is indeed the\n> case, while at other times this is a reasonable abstraction.\" Wikipedia\n\nMermaid can render state diagrams. The syntax tries to be compliant with the syntax used in plantUml as this will make\nit easier for users to share diagrams between mermaid and plantUml.\n\n```mermaid-example\n---\ntitle: Simple sample\n---\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Still\n    Still --> [*]\n\n    Still --> Moving\n    Moving --> Still\n    Moving --> Crash\n    Crash --> [*]\n```\n\nOlder renderer:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram\n    [*] --> Still\n    Still --> [*]\n\n    Still --> Moving\n    Moving --> Still\n    Moving --> Crash\n    Crash --> [*]\n```\n\nIn state diagrams systems are described in terms of _states_ and how one _state_ can change to another _state_ via\na _transition._ The example diagram above shows three states: **Still**, **Moving** and **Crash**. You start in the\n**Still** state. From **Still** you can change to the **Moving** state. From **Moving** you can change either back to the **Still** state or to\nthe **Crash** state.

Here's a basic example:\n\n```php\n$password = \"user_password_here\";\n$hashed_password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n```\n\nThis will generate a secure hash of the password using the default algorithm. Make sure to store the hashed password in your database.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: A sequence diagram is most appropriate here because the process of hashing a password in PHP involves a sequence of steps: receiving the plain password, hashing it using a specific function, and then storing the hashed password. This sequence of operations and the interaction between the user's input and the PHP function can be effectively illustrated using a sequence diagram.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes.

Here is a sample code snippet in PHP using CodeIgniter 3 to retrieve session data after redirection:\n\n```php\n// Set session data before redirection\n$this->session->set_userdata('user_id', 123);\n$this->session->set_userdata('username', 'john_doe');\n\n// Redirect to another page\nredirect('dashboard');\n\n// In the 'dashboard' controller method\npublic function index()\n{\n    // Retrieve session data after redirection\n    $user_id = $this->session->userdata('user_id');\n    $username = $this->session->userdata('username');\n\n    // Use the retrieved session data as needed\n    echo \"User ID: \" . $user_id;\n    echo \"Username: \" . $username;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n- We first set some session data (`user_id` and `username`) before redirecting to the `dashboard` page.\n- After the redirection, in the `dashboard` controller method (e.g., `index()` method), we retrieve the session data using `$this->session->userdata('key')`.\n- Finally, we can use the retrieved session data (`user_id` and `username`) as needed in the `dashboard` page.\n\nThis code demonstrates how you can retrieve session data after redirection in CodeIgniter 3.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation involves a sequence of operations starting with setting session data, redirecting to another page, and then retrieving the session data on the new page.

How do i integrate 'forgot password'? FYI: Everything is SSR and I already have a Nitro plugin for Supabase. \n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\nTo integrate a \"forgot password\" feature in your Nitro / Nuxt project using Supabase Auth, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Client-Side Setup:**\n   - Create a form in your Nuxt project where users can input their email to request a password reset.\n   - When the form is submitted, call a function that triggers the password reset process.\n  \n2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Setup:**\n   - Ensure that your Nitro plugin for Supabase is properly configured to handle server-side requests.\n   - Implement a server-side function to handle the password reset request.\n   - Use Supabase's `supabase.auth.api.resetPasswordForEmail` method to initiate the password reset process.\n\n3. **Password Reset Process:**\n   - When a user requests a password reset, call the server-side function to trigger the `resetPasswordForEmail` method.\n   - This method will send a password reset email to the user's email address with instructions on how to reset their password.\n   - Ensure that the email contains a link to a page where users can securely reset their password.\n\nBy following these steps, you can integrate a \"forgot password\" feature in your Nitro / Nuxt project using Supabase Auth.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: A sequence diagram is the most appropriate choice for illustrating the process of integrating a 'forgot password' feature because it involves interactions between the user, the client-side (Nuxt project), and the server-side (Nitro plugin and Supabase Auth). The sequence diagram can effectively show the order of operations, from the user requesting a password reset to the server handling the request and Supabase sending a reset email.

Here is a breakdown of the HTML code:\n\n- **Title and Meta Tags**: Sets the title of the page and defines the character set and viewport.\n- **Styling**: Applies basic styling to the body and form elements.\n- **Form**: Contains input fields for temperature and a dropdown for selecting the temperature scale.\n- **Script**: Contains JavaScript functions to calculate wind chill, convert temperature scales, and handle form submission.\n- **Event Listener**: Listens for form submission, prevents the default form submission behavior, and calculates wind chill based on user input.\n- **Result Display**: Displays the wind chill results for different wind speeds based on the user's input.\n\nThis HTML code creates a functional Wind Chill Calculator web page. Users can enter the temperature, choose the scale, and see the wind chill results for various wind speeds.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The sequence of operations and interactions between the user, the form, and the JavaScript functions is central to understanding how the Wind Chill Calculator works. A sequence diagram is ideal for illustrating the flow of events from the user submitting the form, through the calculation of wind chill (including the potential conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit), to displaying the results. This diagram type effectively captures the order of operations and the interactions between different components (user, form, JavaScript functions) in a clear, sequential manner.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User as User\n    participant Form as Wind Chill Form\n    participant JS as JavaScript Functions\n    participant Result as Result Display\n\n    User->>Form: Enter temperature and select scale\n    Form->>JS: Submit temperature and scale\n    alt scale is Celsius\n        JS->>JS: Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit\n    end\n    loop for each wind speed\n        JS->>JS: Calculate wind chill\n    end\n    JS->>Result: Display wind chill results\n```"}]}

Here's how you can modify the code:\n\n```csharp\n@if (selectedType == \"Internal\")\n{\n    <DxComboBox Data=\"@payee\"\n                TextFieldName=\"@nameof(PayeeView_.FullName)\"\n                FilteringMode=\"FilteringMode\"\n                AllowUserInput=\"false\"\n                NullText=\"Select...\"\n                CssClass=\"cw-240\"\n                SizeMode=\"SizeMode.Medium\"\n                Value=\"@payeeName\"\n                ValueChanged=\"@((PayeeView_ selectedTitle) => { FilterPayee(selectedTitle); selectedType = \"Internal\"; Submit(); })\" />\n}\nelse if (selectedType == \"Person\")\n{\n    <!-- Add the necessary code for Person type here -->\n}\nelse\n{\n    <!-- Add the necessary code for the default case here -->\n}\n```\n\nBy updating the `ValueChanged` event handler in the `<DxComboBox>`, you can ensure that the `Submit()` method is called after setting the `selectedType` based on the condition. This way, the `Submit()` method will be executed with the appropriate logic based on the selected type before closing the modal.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation provided outlines a process where an action in the UI (selecting a value from a dropdown) triggers a sequence of operations in the backend (the Submit method). This involves interaction between UI components and backend logic, following a specific order of operations based on user input. A sequence diagram is best suited to represent this interaction and the order in which these operations occur, illustrating the flow from the UI event to the backend processing.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page.

When the button is clicked, the `Submit()` method will be triggered.\n\nBy using event binding in this way, you can trigger the `Submit()` method in Blazor when a specific event, such as a button click, occurs in your component.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation describes a sequence of actions that occur when a button is clicked in a Blazor application, leading to the triggering of a Submit method. A sequence diagram is appropriate here because it can effectively illustrate the interaction between the user action (clicking the button) and the system's response (executing the Submit method). This diagram type is well-suited for showing the order of operations and the flow of control in response to events, which is exactly what the explanation outlines.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page.

Here are some key points about mutexes based on the information provided:\n\n- Mutexes keep track of which thread has access to a variable at any given time.\n- Mutexes help avoid concurrent read/write problems where one thread is writing to a variable while another thread is reading from the same variable.\n- Mutexes are used to synchronize access to shared resources in concurrent programming.\n- In Go, mutexes are used to safely manage access to shared data among goroutines.\n- When using mutexes, a thread acquires the mutex to access a critical section of code, ensuring exclusive access to that section.\n- It is important to use mutexes when only one goroutine should access the critical section of code, while channels are used when goroutines need to communicate with each other.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: stateDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation of a mutex involves describing how it manages access to resources, including states like 'locked' and 'unlocked', and transitions between these states based on actions of different threads (e.g., acquiring or releasing the mutex). A state diagram is suitable for illustrating these states and transitions, showing how a mutex controls access to a resource among multiple threads.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> \"A state diagram is a type of diagram used in computer science and related fields to describe the behavior of systems.\n> State diagrams require that the system described is composed of a finite number of states; sometimes, this is indeed the\n> case, while at other times this is a reasonable abstraction.\" Wikipedia\n\nMermaid can render state diagrams. The syntax tries to be compliant with the syntax used in plantUml as this will make\nit easier for users to share diagrams between mermaid and plantUml.\n\n```mermaid-example\n---\ntitle: Simple sample\n---\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Still\n    Still --> [*]\n\n    Still --> Moving\n    Moving --> Still\n    Moving --> Crash\n    Crash --> [*]\n```\n\nOlder renderer:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram\n    [*] --> Still\n    Still --> [*]\n\n    Still --> Moving\n    Moving --> Still\n    Moving --> Crash\n    Crash --> [*]\n```\n\nIn state diagrams systems are described in terms of _states_ and how one _state_ can change to another _state_ via\na _transition._ The example diagram above shows three states: **Still**, **Moving** and **Crash**. You start in the\n**Still** state. From **Still** you can change to the **Moving** state. From **Moving** you can change either back to the **Still** state or to\nthe **Crash** state. There is no transition from **Still** to **Crash**. (You can't crash if you're still.)\n\n## States\n\nA state can be declared in multiple ways. The simplest way is to define a state with just an id:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    stateId\n```\n\nAnother way is by using the state keyword with a description as per below:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    state \"This is a state description\" as s2\n```\n\nAnother way to define a state with a description is to define the state id followed by a colon and the description:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s2 : This is a state description\n```\n\n## Transitions\n\nTransitions are path/edges when one state passes into another. This is represented using text arrow, \"\\-\\-\\>\".\n\nWhen you define a transition between two states and the states are not already defined, the undefined states are defined\nwith the id from the transition. You can later add descriptions to states defined this way.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s1 --> s2\n```\n\nIt is possible to add text to a transition to describe what it represents:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s1 --> s2: A transition\n```\n\n## Start and End\n\nThere are two special states indicating the start and stop of the diagram. These are written with the [\\*] syntax and\nthe direction of the transition to it defines it either as a start or a stop state.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> s1\n    s1 --> [*]\n```\n\n## Composite states\n\nIn a real world use of state diagrams you often end up with diagrams that are multidimensional as one state can\nhave several internal states. These are called composite states in this terminology.\n\nIn order to define a composite state you need to use the state keyword followed by an id and the body of the composite\nstate between \\{\\}. See the example below:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n    state First {\n        [*] --> second\n        second --> [*]\n    }\n```\n\nYou can do this in several layers:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n\n    state First {\n        [*] --> Second\n\n        state Second {\n            [*] --> second\n            second --> Third\n\n            state Third {\n                [*] --> third\n                third --> [*]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nYou can also define transitions also between composite states:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n    First --> Second\n    First --> Third\n\n    state First {\n        [*] --> fir\n        fir --> [*]\n    }\n    state Second {\n        [*] --> sec\n        sec --> [*]\n    }\n    state Third {\n        [*] --> thi\n        thi --> [*]\n    }\n```\n\n_You can not define transitions between internal states belonging to different composite states_\n\n## Choice\n\nSometimes you need to model a choice between two or more paths, you can do so using &lt;&lt;choice&gt;&gt;.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    state if_state <<choice>>\n    [*] --> IsPositive\n    IsPositive --> if_state\n    if_state --> False: if n < 0\n    if_state --> True : if n >= 0\n```\n\n## Forks\n\nIt is possible to specify a fork in the diagram using &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;join&gt;&gt;.\n\n```mermaid-example\n   stateDiagram-v2\n    state fork_state <<fork>>\n      [*] --> fork_state\n      fork_state --> State2\n      fork_state --> State3\n\n      state join_state <<join>>\n      State2 --> join_state\n      State3 --> join_state\n      join_state --> State4\n      State4 --> [*]\n```\n\n## Notes\n\nSometimes nothing says it better than a Post-it note. That is also the case in state diagrams.\n\nHere you can choose to put the note to the _right of_ or to the _left of_ a node.\n\n```mermaid-example\n    stateDiagram-v2\n        State1: The state with a note\n        note right of State1\n            Important information! You can write\n            notes.\n        end note\n        State1 --> State2\n        note left of State2 : This is the note to the left.\n```\n\n## Concurrency\n\nAs in plantUml you can specify concurrency using the -- symbol.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Active\n\n    state Active {\n        [*] --> NumLockOff\n        NumLockOff --> NumLockOn : EvNumLockPressed\n        NumLockOn --> NumLockOff : EvNumLockPressed\n        --\n        [*] --> CapsLockOff\n        CapsLockOff --> CapsLockOn : EvCapsLockPressed\n        CapsLockOn --> CapsLockOff : EvCapsLockPressed\n        --\n        [*] --> ScrollLockOff\n        ScrollLockOff --> ScrollLockOn : EvScrollLockPressed\n        ScrollLockOn --> ScrollLockOff : EvScrollLockPressed\n    }\n```\n\n## Setting the direction of the diagram\n\nWith state diagrams you can use the direction statement to set the direction which the diagram will render like in this\nexample.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram\n    direction LR\n    [*] --> A\n    A --> B\n    B --> C\n    state B {\n      direction LR\n      a --> b\n    }\n    B --> D\n```\n\n## Comments\n\nComments can be entered within a state diagram chart, which will be ignored by the parser. Comments need to be on their\nown line, and must be prefaced with `%%` (double percent signs).

Here is how a mutex works in Python using the `threading` module:\n\n- A mutex is implemented using a `Lock` object from the `threading` module.\n- To acquire the mutex (lock), a thread calls the `acquire()` method on the `Lock` object.\n- If the mutex is available, the thread acquires it and continues execution.\n- If the mutex is already held by another thread, the calling thread will block until the mutex is released.\n- Once the thread is done with the shared resource, it releases the mutex by calling the `release()` method on the `Lock` object.\n- Releasing the mutex allows other threads to acquire it and access the shared resource.\n\nHere is a simple example demonstrating the use of a mutex in Python:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\n# Create a Lock object\nmutex = threading.Lock()\n\ndef shared_resource():\n    # Acquire the mutex\n    mutex.acquire()\n    \n    # Access the shared resource\n    print(\"Accessing the shared resource\")\n    \n    # Release the mutex\n    mutex.release()\n\n# Create two threads accessing the shared resource\nthread1 = threading.Thread(target=shared_resource)\nthread2 = threading.Thread(target=shared_resource)\n\n# Start the threads\nthread1.start()\nthread2.start()\n\n# Wait for the threads to finish\nthread1.join()\nthread2.join()\n```\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: A sequence diagram is the most appropriate for explaining how a mutex works in Python because it involves interactions between different threads and the mutex over time. The sequence diagram can effectively illustrate the order of operations, such as acquiring and releasing the mutex, and how threads interact with the mutex to access a shared resource. This temporal aspect of the operations makes the sequence diagram a better fit than other diagram types for this explanation.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page.

It also includes logic to delete expired messages.\n\nTo organize this code effectively within your Django project, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Signal Handler File (`signals.py`):**\n   - Create a new Python file named `signals.py` within your Django app (where your models are located).\n   - Move the signal handling code (including the `@receiver` decorator and the `track_product_changes` function) to this file.\n\n2. **Model File (`models.py`):**\n   - Ensure that the `Product`, `Message`, and `UserProfile` models are defined in the `models.py` file of your Django app.\n   - Make sure to import the necessary modules in the `models.py` file, such as `from django.db import models`.\n\n3. **Management Command for Deleting Expired Messages:**\n   - Follow the previous instructions to create a management command file for deleting expired messages.\n   - You can place this management command file in the same directory as the `signals.py` file.\n\n4. **App Configuration:**\n   - Make sure to include the `signals.py` file in the `__init__.py` file of your app to ensure the signal handlers are registered when the app is loaded.\n\nBy organizing your code in this way, you separate the signal handling logic into its own file (`signals.py`) and keep the model definitions and other related code in the `models.py` file. Additionally, the management command for deleting expired messages can be placed in a separate file for better organization.\n\nRemember to run the management command periodically to delete expired messages as scheduled.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The provided code snippet and explanation detail a sequence of operations that occur when a Product model is saved, including checking for changes, creating a message if there are changes, and deleting expired messages.

Here is a breakdown of the calculation based on the input values:\n\n- Hours Worked: 50\n- Rate per Hour: $40\n- Category: The category is not explicitly mentioned in the query, but for this calculation, let's assume the category is 'S/ME'.\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n1. **Calculate Gross Pay:**\n   - Gross Pay = Hours Worked * Rate per Hour\n   - Gross Pay = 50 * $40 = $2000\n\n2. **Determine Tax Rate:**\n   - Since the category is 'S/ME', the tax rate is 0.20 (20%)\n\n3. **Calculate Tax Withheld:**\n   - Tax Withheld = Gross Pay * Tax Rate\n   - Tax Withheld = $2000 * 0.20 = $400\n\n4. **Calculate Take Home Pay:**\n   - Take Home Pay = Gross Pay - Tax Withheld\n   - Take Home Pay = $2000 - $400 = $1600\n\n### Expected Results:\n- Tax Withheld: $400\n- Take Home Pay: $1600\n\nTherefore, based on the input values provided (Hours Worked: 50, Rate per Hour: $40, Category: 'S/ME'), the expected tax withheld amount is $400, and the expected take-home pay is $1600.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The provided code and explanation detail a sequence of operations that occur from the moment a user interacts with a web page (clicking a button) to the calculation of tax withheld and take-home pay, and finally displaying the results. A sequence diagram is most appropriate here because it can effectively illustrate the order of these operations and the interaction between different functions (getValues, getTaxWithheld, showResults) and user actions (click events).\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page.

Parse the URL parameters to extract the form data.\n2. Display the extracted form data on the \"proshli.html\" page.\n\nHere is a sample JavaScript code snippet that you can use on the \"proshli.html\" page to achieve this:\n\n```javascript\n// Parse the URL parameters\nconst urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);\n\n// Get the form data from the URL parameters\nconst username = urlParams.get('username');\nconst password = urlParams.get('password');\nconst email = urlParams.get('email');\nconst option = urlParams.get('option');\nconst enrollmentYear = urlParams.get('enrollmentYear');\nconst studyDirection = urlParams.get('studyDirection');\nconst feedback = urlParams.get('feedback');\n\n// Display the form data on the page\ndocument.getElementById('username').innerText = username;\ndocument.getElementById('password').innerText = password;\ndocument.getElementById('email').innerText = email;\ndocument.getElementById('option').innerText = option;\ndocument.getElementById('enrollmentYear').innerText = enrollmentYear;\ndocument.getElementById('studyDirection').innerText = studyDirection;\ndocument.getElementById('feedback').innerText = feedback;\n```\n\nIn your \"proshli.html\" page, you should have placeholders (like `<span>` elements with specific IDs) where you want to display the form data. For example:\n\n```html\n<p>Username: <span id=\"username\"></span></p>\n<p>Password: <span id=\"password\"></span></p>\n<p>Email: <span id=\"email\"></span></p>\n<p>Are you a mathematician: <span id=\"option\"></span></p>\n<p>Enrollment Year: <span id=\"enrollmentYear\"></span></p>\n<p>Study Direction: <span id=\"studyDirection\"></span></p>\n<p>Feedback: <span id=\"feedback\"></span></p>\n```\n\nBy using the JavaScript code above and including placeholders for the form data on the \"proshli.html\" page, you can extract the form data from the URL parameters and display it dynamically on the page.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The process described involves a sequence of steps to extract form data from URL parameters and display it on a web page.

Ensure that the `selectedType` variable is accessible in the scope where the code block is located.\n2. Update the code block to include a check for `selectedType` before executing the logic inside the `if (ActiveTabIndex == 0)` block.\n\nHere's how you can modify the code block to bind the value of `selectedType`:\n\n```csharp\nif (ActiveTabIndex == 0)\n{\n    responsiblityCenter = await _responsibilityService.GetResponView();\n    user = await _userService.All(\"\",\"\");\n    \n    if (voucherId > 0)\n    {\n        // Other existing logic\n        \n        // Add the following code to bind the value of selectedType\n        if (selectedType == \"Internal\")\n        {\n            user = await _userService.All(\"\", \"\");\n            selectedTypeVariable = selectedType;\n            selectedPayeeLabel = SelectedUser?.FullName;\n        }\n        else if (selectedType == \"Person\")\n        {\n            payeeName = payee.FirstOrDefault(a => a.PayeeId == PayeeId);\n            selectedTypeVariable = selectedType;\n            selectedPayeeLabel = payeeName?.FullName;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            SelectedCom = CompanyView.FirstOrDefault(a => a.PayeeId == PayeeId);\n            selectedTypeVariable = selectedType;\n            selectedPayeeLabel = SelectedCom?.CompanyName;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy adding this conditional logic within the `if (ActiveTabIndex == 0)` block, you can bind the value of `selectedType` to the appropriate variables based on the selected type (Person, Internal, or other).\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The provided scenario involves a sequence of operations that depend on the value of 'selectedType' and the active tab index. It describes how different parts of the system interact based on these conditions, making a sequence diagram the most appropriate choice. This diagram type can effectively illustrate the order of operations and the conditional interactions between different components of the system, such as the user interface elements and service calls, based on the user's selection and other conditions.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page.

The goal seems to be to switch turns between two players after a single card click or move. Let's address potential issues and solutions for each function:\n\n### `SwitchTurns` Function\n\nThe `SwitchTurns` function toggles the turn between two players and updates the UI to reflect whose turn it is. The function correctly toggles the `isPlayer1Turn` boolean variable and updates the UI elements (`label1` and `label2`) to visually indicate the active player. However, there was a mistake in the font size adjustment in your initial approach, which was corrected in the provided solution. Ensure you have the corrected version:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void SwitchTurns()\n{\n    isPlayer1Turn = !isPlayer1Turn;\n\n    if (isPlayer1Turn)\n    {\n        MessageBox.Show(\"Player 1's Turn\");\n        label1.ForeColor = Color.Black;\n        label2.ForeColor = Color.Red;\n        label1.Font = new Font(label1.Font.FontFamily, normalFontSize, FontStyle.Regular);\n        label2.Font = new Font(label2.Font.FontFamily, turnFontSize, FontStyle.Bold);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        label1.ForeColor = Color.Red;\n        label2.ForeColor = Color.Black;\n        label2.Font = new Font(label2.Font.FontFamily, normalFontSize, FontStyle.Regular);\n        label1.Font = new Font(label1.Font.FontFamily, turnFontSize, FontStyle.Bold);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### `Cards_Click` Function\n\nThe `Cards_Click` function is triggered when a card is clicked. It performs several operations, including setting the clicked card's image, removing the used image from a list, and adding the clicked card to a list of clicked cards. If a condition is met (in your case, checking if all 2-10 cards are clicked, which seems to be mistakenly set to check for just one card), it moves the clicked cards to a discard pile and then switches turns.\n\nTo ensure that turns switch after each card click or move, you should call `SwitchTurns` at the end of the `Cards_Click` function, outside any conditional checks that are not related to the turn switching itself. Here's a simplified example of how to incorporate the turn switch after a card is clicked:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void Cards_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    PictureBox pictureBox = sender as PictureBox;\n    if (pictureBox != null && images.Count > 0)\n    {\n        // Existing logic for handling a card click\n\n        // Always switch turns after handling the card click\n        SwitchTurns();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that regardless of other game logic, the turn will switch after a card is clicked.\n\n### Summary\n\n- Ensure the `SwitchTurns` function uses the corrected approach for font size adjustment.\n- Modify the `Cards_Click` function to call `SwitchTurns` at the end of the function to switch turns after every card click.\n\nThese adjustments should address the problem of switching turns between players after each move.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation provided involves a sequence of operations and interactions between different components (functions and UI elements) following specific events (like a card click). A sequence diagram is ideal for illustrating how these components interact over time, especially the order in which functions are called and how the state changes in response to user actions. It captures the flow of control and data among the system components effectively, making it the most suitable diagram type for this explanation.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page.

The `send_message_via_webhook` function expects only the `message_text` argument, but in the code, it is being called with two arguments (`webhook_url` and `message_text`).\n\n### Solution:\nTo fix the issue, you need to modify the call to `send_message_via_webhook` to only pass the `message_text` as an argument. Here's the corrected line of code:\n\n```python\nsend_message_via_webhook(message_text)\n```\n\nBy making this change, the `send_message_via_webhook` function will be called correctly with the expected single argument, resolving the issue in the code.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation and the provided code snippet describe a sequence of operations that occur, including function calls and conditional checks. A sequence diagram is best suited to represent the order of operations and the interaction between different parts of the system, such as function calls and responses. It can effectively illustrate the flow from the `track_product_changes` function to the `send_message_via_webhook` function, including the decision-making process based on the condition checks.

In the provided code snippet, it seems like you are trying to execute a SQL query using `session.exec(statement)`, but the `exec` method is not a standard method for a session object.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can use the `execute` method instead of `exec` to execute the SQL query. Here's how you can modify the `startup` function:\n\n```python\nasync def startup(session):\n    statement = select(Product).where(Product.name == \"access_management\")\n    result = await session.execute(statement)\n    if not result.unique().all():\n        am_product = Product(product_type=\"APPLICATION\", name=\"access_management\", description=\"Access Management\")\n        session.add(am_product)\n        await session.commit()\n```\n\nBy replacing `session.exec(statement)` with `session.execute(statement)`, you should be able to execute the SQL query correctly.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation provided involves the interaction between different components (such as the session object and the database) and the order in which these interactions occur (e.g., executing a SQL statement, checking results, and possibly adding a new product to the database).

It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant S as Session\n    participant DB as Database\n    S->>DB: select(Product).where(Product.name == \"access_management\")\n    Note over S,DB: Using session.execute(statement)\n    DB-->>S: Query Result\n    alt If no result\n        S->>DB: Add new Product\n        S->>S: session.commit()\n    end\n```"}]}

Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The provided code snippet describes the interactions between various components and functions within a React application, specifically focusing on fetching data, handling user interactions like replying to comments, adding new replies, and deleting comments. A sequence diagram is most appropriate here as it can effectively illustrate the order of operations and interactions between components and functions over time, such as the sequence of events triggered by user actions or lifecycle methods in the React component.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant App\n    participant useEffect\n    participant fetchData\n    participant fetch\n    participant handleReply\n    participant addNewReplies\n    participant handleDeleteComments\n    participant Counter\n    participant Header\n    participant Content\n    participant ReplyForm\n\n    App->>useEffect: Initializes\n    useEffect->>fetchData: Calls on component mount\n    fetchData->>fetch: Requests data from server\n    fetch->>App: Sets data state\n\n    App->>Counter: Renders for each comment\n    App->>Header: Renders user info for each comment\n    App->>Content: Renders content for each comment\n    App->>ReplyForm: Conditionally renders for adding replies\n\n    App->>handleReply: On reply button click\n    handleReply->>App: Sets selectedReplyId\n\n    App->>addNewReplies: On submit reply form\n    addNewReplies->>App: Updates comments and replies state\n\n    App->>handleDeleteComments: On delete comment\n    handleDeleteComments->>App: Filters out deleted comment from data\n```"}]}
