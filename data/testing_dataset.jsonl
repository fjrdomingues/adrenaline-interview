Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!\n\nTask\nGiven  names and phone numbers, assemble a phone book that maps friends' names to their respective phone numbers. You will then be given an unknown number of names to query your phone book for. For each  queried, print the associated entry from your phone book on a new line in the form name=phoneNumber; if an entry for  is not found, print Not found instead.\n\nNote: Your phone book should be a Dictionary/Map/HashMap data structure.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of entries in the phone book.\nEach of the  subsequent lines describes an entry in the form of  space-separated values on a single line. The first value is a friend's name, and the second value is an -digit phone number.\n\nAfter the  lines of phone book entries, there are an unknown number of lines of queries. Each line (query) contains a  to look up, and you must continue reading lines until there is no more input.\n\nNote: Names consist of lowercase English alphabetic letters and are first names only.\n\nConstraints\n\nOutput Format\n\nOn a new line for each query, print Not found if the name has no corresponding entry in the phone book; otherwise, print the full  and  in the format name=phoneNumber.\n\nSample Input\n\n3\nsam 99912222\ntom 11122222\nharry 12299933\nsam\nedward\nharry\nSample Output\n\nsam=99912222\nNot found\nharry=12299933\nExplanation\n\nWe add the following  (Key,Value) pairs to our map so it looks like this:\n\n\nWe then process each query and print key=value if the queried  is found in the map; otherwise, we print Not found.\n\nQuery 0: sam\nSam is one of the keys in our dictionary, so we print sam=99912222.\n\nQuery 1: edward\nEdward is not one of the keys in our dictionary, so we print Not found.\n\nQuery 2: harry\nHarry is one of the keys in our dictionary, so we print harry=12299933.\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\nAnswer generation was manually stopped.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The task involves a sequence of operations starting with creating a phone book, followed by querying this phone book for specific names. A sequence diagram is suitable for illustrating the order of these operations, including the decision-making process involved in checking if a name exists in the phone book and then either retrieving the phone number or indicating that the entry is not found. This process is inherently sequential and involves interactions between the user, the phone book data structure, and the output, making a sequence diagram the most appropriate choice.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you.

How do i integrate 'forgot password'? FYI: Everything is SSR and I already have a Nitro plugin for Supabase. \n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\nTo integrate a \"forgot password\" feature in your Nitro / Nuxt project using Supabase Auth, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Client-Side Setup:**\n   - Create a form in your Nuxt project where users can input their email to request a password reset.\n   - When the form is submitted, call a function that triggers the password reset process.\n  \n2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Setup:**\n   - Ensure that your Nitro plugin for Supabase is properly configured to handle server-side requests.\n   - Implement a server-side function to handle the password reset request.\n   - Use Supabase's `supabase.auth.api.resetPasswordForEmail` method to initiate the password reset process.\n\n3. **Password Reset Process:**\n   - When a user requests a password reset, call the server-side function to trigger the `resetPasswordForEmail` method.\n   - This method will send a password reset email to the user's email address with instructions on how to reset their password.\n   - Ensure that the email contains a link to a page where users can securely reset their password.\n\nBy following these steps, you can integrate a \"forgot password\" feature in your Nitro / Nuxt project using Supabase Auth.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: A sequence diagram is the most appropriate choice for illustrating the process of integrating a 'forgot password' feature because it involves interactions between the user, the client-side (Nuxt project), and the server-side (Nitro plugin and Supabase Auth).

Here are some key points about mutexes based on the information provided:\n\n- A mutex allows only one thread to lock and own it at a time.\n- It is used to prevent race conditions where multiple threads access shared data concurrently.\n- When a thread locks a mutex, it becomes the owner and can access the protected resources.\n- If another thread tries to lock the mutex while it is already locked, the requesting thread will be suspended and queued until the mutex is unlocked.\n- Mutexes are commonly used to protect critical sections of code where shared data is accessed and modified by multiple threads.\n\nIf you need more specific information or code examples, please let me know!\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: stateDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation of a mutex involves describing its states (locked, unlocked) and the transitions between these states based on actions taken by threads (locking, unlocking). A state diagram is well-suited to represent these concepts because it can clearly illustrate the different states a mutex can be in and how it transitions between these states depending on the actions of threads. This makes it easier to understand the behavior of mutexes in concurrent programming.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> \"A state diagram is a type of diagram used in computer science and related fields to describe the behavior of systems.\n> State diagrams require that the system described is composed of a finite number of states; sometimes, this is indeed the\n> case, while at other times this is a reasonable abstraction.\" Wikipedia\n\nMermaid can render state diagrams. The syntax tries to be compliant with the syntax used in plantUml as this will make\nit easier for users to share diagrams between mermaid and plantUml.\n\n```mermaid-example\n---\ntitle: Simple sample\n---\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Still\n    Still --> [*]\n\n    Still --> Moving\n    Moving --> Still\n    Moving --> Crash\n    Crash --> [*]\n```\n\nOlder renderer:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram\n    [*] --> Still\n    Still --> [*]\n\n    Still --> Moving\n    Moving --> Still\n    Moving --> Crash\n    Crash --> [*]\n```\n\nIn state diagrams systems are described in terms of _states_ and how one _state_ can change to another _state_ via\na _transition._ The example diagram above shows three states: **Still**, **Moving** and **Crash**. You start in the\n**Still** state. From **Still** you can change to the **Moving** state. From **Moving** you can change either back to the **Still** state or to\nthe **Crash** state. There is no transition from **Still** to **Crash**. (You can't crash if you're still.)\n\n## States\n\nA state can be declared in multiple ways. The simplest way is to define a state with just an id:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    stateId\n```\n\nAnother way is by using the state keyword with a description as per below:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    state \"This is a state description\" as s2\n```\n\nAnother way to define a state with a description is to define the state id followed by a colon and the description:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s2 : This is a state description\n```\n\n## Transitions\n\nTransitions are path/edges when one state passes into another. This is represented using text arrow, \"\\-\\-\\>\".\n\nWhen you define a transition between two states and the states are not already defined, the undefined states are defined\nwith the id from the transition. You can later add descriptions to states defined this way.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s1 --> s2\n```\n\nIt is possible to add text to a transition to describe what it represents:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s1 --> s2: A transition\n```\n\n## Start and End\n\nThere are two special states indicating the start and stop of the diagram. These are written with the [\\*] syntax and\nthe direction of the transition to it defines it either as a start or a stop state.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> s1\n    s1 --> [*]\n```\n\n## Composite states\n\nIn a real world use of state diagrams you often end up with diagrams that are multidimensional as one state can\nhave several internal states. These are called composite states in this terminology.\n\nIn order to define a composite state you need to use the state keyword followed by an id and the body of the composite\nstate between \\{\\}. See the example below:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n    state First {\n        [*] --> second\n        second --> [*]\n    }\n```\n\nYou can do this in several layers:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n\n    state First {\n        [*] --> Second\n\n        state Second {\n            [*] --> second\n            second --> Third\n\n            state Third {\n                [*] --> third\n                third --> [*]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nYou can also define transitions also between composite states:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n    First --> Second\n    First --> Third\n\n    state First {\n        [*] --> fir\n        fir --> [*]\n    }\n    state Second {\n        [*] --> sec\n        sec --> [*]\n    }\n    state Third {\n        [*] --> thi\n        thi --> [*]\n    }\n```\n\n_You can not define transitions between internal states belonging to different composite states_\n\n## Choice\n\nSometimes you need to model a choice between two or more paths, you can do so using &lt;&lt;choice&gt;&gt;.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    state if_state <<choice>>\n    [*] --> IsPositive\n    IsPositive --> if_state\n    if_state --> False: if n < 0\n    if_state --> True : if n >= 0\n```\n\n## Forks\n\nIt is possible to specify a fork in the diagram using &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;join&gt;&gt;.\n\n```mermaid-example\n   stateDiagram-v2\n    state fork_state <<fork>>\n      [*] --> fork_state\n      fork_state --> State2\n      fork_state --> State3\n\n      state join_state <<join>>\n      State2 --> join_state\n      State3 --> join_state\n      join_state --> State4\n      State4 --> [*]\n```\n\n## Notes\n\nSometimes nothing says it better than a Post-it note. That is also the case in state diagrams.\n\nHere you can choose to put the note to the _right of_ or to the _left of_ a node.\n\n```mermaid-example\n    stateDiagram-v2\n        State1: The state with a note\n        note right of State1\n            Important information! You can write\n            notes.\n        end note\n        State1 --> State2\n        note left of State2 : This is the note to the left.\n```\n\n## Concurrency\n\nAs in plantUml you can specify concurrency using the -- symbol.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Active\n\n    state Active {\n        [*] --> NumLockOff\n        NumLockOff --> NumLockOn : EvNumLockPressed\n        NumLockOn --> NumLockOff : EvNumLockPressed\n        --\n        [*] --> CapsLockOff\n        CapsLockOff --> CapsLockOn : EvCapsLockPressed\n        CapsLockOn --> CapsLockOff : EvCapsLockPressed\n        --\n        [*] --> ScrollLockOff\n        ScrollLockOff --> ScrollLockOn : EvScrollLockPressed\n        ScrollLockOn --> ScrollLockOff : EvScrollLockPressed\n    }\n```\n\n## Setting the direction of the diagram\n\nWith state diagrams you can use the direction statement to set the direction which the diagram will render like in this\nexample.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram\n    direction LR\n    [*] --> A\n    A --> B\n    B --> C\n    state B {\n      direction LR\n      a --> b\n    }\n    B --> D\n```\n\n## Comments\n\nComments can be entered within a state diagram chart, which will be ignored by the parser. Comments need to be on their\nown line, and must be prefaced with `%%` (double percent signs). Any text after the start of the comment to the next\nnewline will be treated as a comment, including any diagram syntax\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Still\n    Still --> [*]\n%% this is a comment\n    Still --> Moving\n    Moving --> Still %% another comment\n    Moving --> Crash\n    Crash --> [*]\n```\n\n\n# Your output"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Unlocked\n    Unlocked --> Locked : Thread locks\n    Locked --> Unlocked : Owner unlocks\n    Locked --> Locked : Another thread tries to lock\n    note right of Locked\n        Only the thread that locked\n        the mutex can unlock it.\n    end note\n    note left of Unlocked\n        Mutex is available for locking.\n    end note\n```"}]}

The goal seems to be to switch turns between two players after a single card click or move. Let's address potential issues and solutions for each function:\n\n### `SwitchTurns` Function\n\nThe `SwitchTurns` function toggles the turn between two players and updates the UI to reflect whose turn it is. The function correctly toggles the `isPlayer1Turn` boolean variable and updates the UI elements (`label1` and `label2`) to visually indicate the active player. However, there was a mistake in the font size adjustment in your initial approach, which was corrected in the provided solution. Ensure you have the corrected version:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void SwitchTurns()\n{\n    isPlayer1Turn = !isPlayer1Turn;\n\n    if (isPlayer1Turn)\n    {\n        MessageBox.Show(\"Player 1's Turn\");\n        label1.ForeColor = Color.Black;\n        label2.ForeColor = Color.Red;\n        label1.Font = new Font(label1.Font.FontFamily, normalFontSize, FontStyle.Regular);\n        label2.Font = new Font(label2.Font.FontFamily, turnFontSize, FontStyle.Bold);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        label1.ForeColor = Color.Red;\n        label2.ForeColor = Color.Black;\n        label2.Font = new Font(label2.Font.FontFamily, normalFontSize, FontStyle.Regular);\n        label1.Font = new Font(label1.Font.FontFamily, turnFontSize, FontStyle.Bold);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### `Cards_Click` Function\n\nThe `Cards_Click` function is triggered when a card is clicked. It performs several operations, including setting the clicked card's image, removing the used image from a list, and adding the clicked card to a list of clicked cards. If a condition is met (in your case, checking if all 2-10 cards are clicked, which seems to be mistakenly set to check for just one card), it moves the clicked cards to a discard pile and then switches turns.\n\nTo ensure that turns switch after each card click or move, you should call `SwitchTurns` at the end of the `Cards_Click` function, outside any conditional checks that are not related to the turn switching itself. Here's a simplified example of how to incorporate the turn switch after a card is clicked:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void Cards_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    PictureBox pictureBox = sender as PictureBox;\n    if (pictureBox != null && images.Count > 0)\n    {\n        // Existing logic for handling a card click\n\n        // Always switch turns after handling the card click\n        SwitchTurns();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that regardless of other game logic, the turn will switch after a card is clicked.\n\n### Summary\n\n- Ensure the `SwitchTurns` function uses the corrected approach for font size adjustment.\n- Modify the `Cards_Click` function to call `SwitchTurns` at the end of the function to switch turns after every card click.\n\nThese adjustments should address the problem of switching turns between players after each move.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation provided involves a sequence of operations and interactions between different components (functions and UI elements) following specific events (like a card click). A sequence diagram is ideal for illustrating how these components interact over time, especially the order in which functions are called and how the state changes in response to user actions. It captures the flow of control and data among the system components effectively, making it the most suitable diagram type for this explanation.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you.
