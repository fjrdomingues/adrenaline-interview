This parameter is a \\\"placeholder\\\" for the actual text whose lexical diversity we want to compute, and reoccurs in the block of code that will run when the function is used, in line \\u00a9. Similarly, percentage() is defined to take two parameters, labeled count and total \\u00a9. Once Python knows that lexical_diversity() and percentage() are the names for specific blocks of code, we can go ahead and use these functions: To recap, we use or call a function such as lexical_diversity() by typing its name, followed by an open parenthesis, the name of the text, and then a close parenthesis. These parentheses will show up often; their role is to separate the name of a task\\u2014such as lexical_diversity()\\u2014from the data that the task is to be performed on\\u2014such as text3. The data value that we place in the parentheses when we call a function is an argument to the function. You have already encountered several functions in this chapter, such as len(), set(), and sorted().

The query selects specific columns from the `product_product` table and performs a left join with the `product_category` table.\n\n6. **Reading Data into DataFrame**:\n   - Uses `pd.read_sql` to execute the SQL query and read the result set into a pandas DataFrame `df`.\n\n7. **Writing Data to Excel File**:\n   - Writes the data from the DataFrame to an Excel file located at `excel_file_path` using the `to_excel` method. The `index=False` parameter ensures that the DataFrame index is not included in the Excel file.\n\n8. **Closing Database Connection**:\n   - Closes the connection to the SQLite database using `conn.close()` to release resources.\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates reading data from a SQLite database into a pandas DataFrame and then exporting that data to an Excel file in a specified folder.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"GitHub - renanbdr/from_pandas_to_sqlite\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/renanbdr/from_pandas_to_sqlite\", \"content\": \" This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

        "prompt": "# Question\nplease create documentation for the same\n\n# Answer\n\nGiven the information provided, I'll create a basic structure for documentation that could serve as the foundation for a technical design document focused on the LibreTranslate project. This document will include sections relevant to the code snippets and configurations provided earlier. Note that more detailed information and specific implementation details would be required to fully flesh out each section. \n\n### LibreTranslate Technical Design Document\n\n#### Overview\nThis section provides a high-level summary of the LibreTranslate project, including its purpose, scope, and main functionalities. \n\n#### Architecture\nDiscuss the overall architecture of LibreTranslate, including the front-end interface, back-end services, and any APIs it interacts with. \n\n#### Front-End Design\n##### Interface\nDetail the user interface components, referencing the Materialize CSS framework used for styling as seen in [`libretranslate/static/css/materialize.min.css`](libretranslate/static/css/materialize.min.css).\n\n```type:Generated,lang:CSS,path:,lines:0-0\n.tap-target,.tap-target-wrapper{width:600px;height:600px}\n```\n\n\n\n##### User Interactions\nDescribe how users interact with the application through the interface, including translations, language selection, and any other features.\n\n#### Back-End Design\n##### Configuration\nOutline the server-side configurations, specifically mentioning the rate limiting configuration named `HOURLY_REQ_LIMIT_DECAY` found in [`libretranslate/default_values.py`](libretranslate/default_values.py#L70).\n\n```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0\n'name': 'HOURLY_REQ_LIMIT_DECAY',\n```\n\n\n\n##### Data Flow\nIllustrate how data flows from the point of user input to the translation output, including any external APIs or services used for translation functionalities. \n\n#### API Design\nProvide details on the API endpoints exposed by LibreTranslate, including request/response formats, authentication methods (if any), and rate limiting.\n\n#### Trademark and Open Source Guidelines\nSummarize the guidelines for using LibreTranslate's name and code as specified in the [`TRADEMARK.md`](TRADEMARK.md#L52-L69) document, focusing on the dos and don'ts for developers.\n\n```type:Generated,lang:Markdown,path:,lines:0-0\n* Use any LibreTranslate trademark in connection with the user-facing name or branding of your project.\n```\n\n\n#### Security Considerations\nDiscuss the security measures in place or recommended for LibreTranslate, including data protection and secure API design.\n\n#### Deployment\nDescribe the recommended deployment process and environment for LibreTranslate, including any dependencies and external services required.\n\n#### Future Enhancements\nOutline potential future enhancements and features that could be added to LibreTranslate, taking into account community feedback and technological advancements.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis technical design document provides a structured overview of the LibreTranslate project, from user interface design to backend configurations and API design. It serves as a starting point for developers and contributors to understand the project's structure and guidelines for contribution. \n\nThis document will require updates as the project evolves, including more detailed sections on security, deployment, and specific implementation strategies for new features. \n\nRemember, this is a basic template and should be expanded with more detailed technical information specific to the LibreTranslate project's requirements and design decisions.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"CODE\", \"code\": \"\", \"file_path\": \"libretranslate/templates/index.html\", \"line_ranges\": [[25, 26]], \"max_chunk_size\": null}, {\"type\": \"CODE\", \"code\": \"        'name': 'HOURLY_REQ_LIMIT_DECAY',\", \"file_path\": \"libretranslate/default_values.py\", \"line_ranges\": [[69, 70]], \"max_chunk_size\": null}, {\"type\": \"CODE\", \"code\": \"For example, you cannot name your account, page, or community \\\"LibreTranslate Representatives\\\" or \\\"LibreTranslate Software\\\".

Here's a Python code snippet to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport phonenumbers\nfrom phonenumbers import geocoder, carrier, timezone\n\ndef test_phone_anonymity(phone_numbers):\n    for phone_num in phone_numbers:\n        print(\"\\nProcessing phone number:\", phone_num)\n        try:\n            number = phonenumbers.parse(phone_num, \"RU\")\n            coordinates = geocoder.description_for_number(number, \"ru\")\n            city = geocoder.description_for_number(number, \"ru\")\n            \n            if city:\n                print(\"\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434: \", city)\n            \n            country = geocoder.description_for_number(number, \"ru\")\n            if country:\n                print(\"\u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430: \", country)\n                print(\"\u0410\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441: \", city, country)\n            \n            time_zone = timezone.time_zones_for_number(number)\n            network = carrier.name_for_number(number, \"ru\")\n            if network:\n                print(\"\u041e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0438: \", network)\n            \n            valid = phonenumbers.is_valid_number(number)\n            print(\"\u0412\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043d\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0430: \", valid)\n            print(\"\u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0437\u043e\u043d\u0430:\", time_zone)\n            print(\"\u041a\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0442\u044b:\", coordinates)\n            print(f\"TG: t.me/{phone_num}\")\n            print(f\"GOOGLE: google.com/search/{phone_num}\")\n            print(\"by @cyberakamai\")\n        \n        except Exception as e:\n            print(\"Error processing phone number:\", phone_num)\n            print(\"Error:\", e)\n\n# Example list of phone numbers to process\nphone_numbers = [\"+1234567890\", \"+1987654321\", \"+1122334455\"]\n\n# Define the batch size\nbatch_size = 2\n\n# Process phone numbers in batches\nfor i in range(0, len(phone_numbers), batch_size):\n    batch = phone_numbers[i:i+batch_size]\n    test_phone_anonymity(batch)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The `test_phone_anonymity` function processes a list of phone numbers.\n- The provided phone numbers are split into batches based on the `batch_size`.\n- Each batch of phone numbers is processed using the `test_phone_anonymity` function.\n- Error handling is implemented to catch any exceptions that may occur during processing.\n\nYou can adjust the `phone_numbers` list with the phone numbers you want to process and modify the `batch_size` according to your requirements. This code will effectively handle multiple phone numbers in batches using the `phonenumbers` library functions.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"phonenumbers\", \"url\": \"https://pypi.org/project/phonenumbers/8.10.21/\", \"content\": \"This is not needed to run the Python code, but is needed when upstream changes to the master metadata need to be incorporated.

        "prompt": "# Question\nHow can you ensure that state is updated immutably when filtering out data?\n\n# Answer\n### Updating State Immutably when Filtering Data:\nWhen filtering out data from an array in React state, it's important to update the state immutably to ensure that React detects the change and triggers re-renders correctly. Here's how you can ensure that the state is updated immutably when filtering out data:\n\n1. **Using the Spread Operator**:\n   - Create a new array by spreading the existing data array and filtering out the data to be removed.\n   - Set the state with the new array to maintain immutability.\n\n   ```javascript\n   function handleDeleteComments(commentId) {\n     const updatedData = data.filter((comment) => comment.id !== commentId);\n     setData([...updatedData]);\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Using Array.prototype.slice()**:\n   - Use `slice()` to create a shallow copy of the data array and then filter out the data.\n   - Set the state with the new array to ensure immutability.\n\n   ```javascript\n   function handleDeleteComments(commentId) {\n     const updatedData = data.slice().filter((comment) => comment.id !== commentId);\n     setData(updatedData);\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Using Array.prototype.filter() with Object Spread**:\n   - If the data structure is more complex (e.g., nested objects), you can use object spread to maintain immutability.\n\n   ```javascript\n   function handleDeleteComments(commentId) {\n     const updatedData = data.map((comment) => {\n       if (comment.id !== commentId) {\n         return { ...comment };\n       }\n     }).filter(Boolean); // Filter out undefined values\n     setData(updatedData);\n   }\n   ```\n\nBy following these approaches and ensuring that the state is updated immutably when filtering out data, you can maintain the integrity of the React state and trigger re-renders effectively.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Simplify Deep State Updates using Immer produce\", \"url\": \"https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-simplify-deep-state-updates-using-immer-produce\", \"content\": \"For example, when you think about what's happening here, is that we're just expressing that we want to add something to our collection.

Note that filter does not modify the original array. Transforming an array   If you want to change some or all items of the array, you can use map() to create a new array. The function you will pass to map can decide what to do with each item, based on its data or its index (or both). In this example, an array holds coordinates of two circles and a square. When you press the button, it moves only the circles down by 100 pixels. It does this by producing a new array of data using map():   import { useState } from 'react';    Replacing items in an array   It is particularly common to want to replace one or more items in an array. Assignments like arr = 'bird' are mutating the original array, so instead you\\u2019ll want to use map for this as well.

So the answer is to use Map\\u2019s setIn method on the state Map to traverse down the hierarchy to the heroList List, and then use List\\u2019s concat method to add the new values to our List, like so:  state.setIn(['heroes'], state.getIn(['heroes', 'heroList']).concat(heroList));   state.setIn(['heroes']... \\u2013 traverses down to the value of the heroes property (i.e. the heroList List) Add new key/values to a Map nested deeply within a List\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Advanced Immutable.js Recipes: How to use Immutable.js in the real world\", \"url\": \"http://untangled.io/advanced-immutable-js-recipes-how-to-use-immutable-js-in-the-real-world/\", \"content\": \"Add new key/values to a Map nested deeply within a List Suppose your data comprises a List of Maps, with each Map containing its own deeply nested Map.

BACK- AND- MIDDLE GROUND Many aquatic plants have remarkable reproductive abilities and develop new stems and leaves successively even when they are cut off. Stem plants in particular develop multiple new shoots and form branches through repeated trimmings. The density of stems and leaves increases through repeated trimmings, and beautiful bushes are formed. Although the nodes of newly planted stem plants are often long and their leaves may be large, if provided with a good environment in an aquarium, the nodes shorten and leaves become uniformly small through trimming. The same thing is true for Glossostigma, which is often planted in the foreground. The leaves that develop right after planting are somewhat large, but with repeated trimming, the leaves become smaller and they grow denser as well. Stem plants are shaped by changing the angle of scissors so that the cut surfaces form a gentle sphere. During the first trimming, the stems are cut short.

Here's how you can modify the `startup` function:\n\n```python\nasync def startup(session):\n    statement = select(Product).where(Product.name == \"access_management\")\n    result = await session.execute(statement)\n    if not result.unique().all():\n        am_product = Product(product_type=\"APPLICATION\", name=\"access_management\", description=\"Access Management\")\n        session.add(am_product)\n        await session.commit()\n```\n\nBy replacing `session.exec(statement)` with `session.execute(statement)`, you should be able to execute the SQL query correctly.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"5 Common Asyncio Errors in Python (and how to avoid them)\", \"url\": \"https://superfastpython.com/asyncio-common-errors/\", \"content\": \"Coroutines look like functions but aren\\u2019t used like functions.

Other SAS code includes PROC SUMMARY datasets that can be simply aggregated and merged into a new SAS dataset without having to leave the DATA step. In addition to reading the code in a more logical way, the process enables faster and more efficient performance. In this paper, I examine existing SAS code examples and discuss how to convert them to include this new and exciting DOW-loop method. The DOW-loop is an abbreviation of a \\\"DO\\\" and a \\\"W\\\" combined together. The \\\"W\\\" refers to the first letter of Dr. Ian Whitlock's last name, which in February 16, 2000, responded to an inquiry on the University of Georgia's SAS-L listserv about a way to access values of variables, especially when there is more than one value to deal with. The solution to that famous question was a simple array filling and manipulation using the DO UNTIL (LAST.ID) construct. The \\\"DO\\\" either refers to the DO-loop or as suggested by Dorfman and Shajenko's paper SS-01, indicates the first two letters of Don Henderson's first name. Ian Whitlock may have heard about this looping construct through Mr. Henderson as early as the late eighties.

        "prompt": "# Question\nCan you provide an example of how Mermaid syntax is used to create diagrams and flowcharts?\n\n# Answer\nCertainly! Mermaid is a tool that allows you to create diagrams and flowcharts using a text-based syntax, which can then be rendered into visual graphs. Here's a simple example of how you can use Mermaid syntax to create a flowchart:\n\n### Mermaid Flowchart Example\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Start] --> B[Process 1]\n    B --> C{Decision Point}\n    C -->|Yes| D[Process 2A]\n    C -->|No| E[Process 2B]\n    D --> F[End]\n    E --> F\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **`graph TD`**: This line indicates the type of graph (in this case, a flowchart) and the direction of flow (`TD` stands for Top-Down). Other directions include LR (Left to Right), RL (Right to Left), and BT (Bottom to Top).\n\n2. **Nodes and Text**:\n   - **`A[Start]`**: Defines a node labeled \"Start\". Square brackets are used to create rectangular nodes.\n   - **`C{Decision Point}`**: Defines a decision node labeled \"Decision Point\". Curly braces create diamond-shaped nodes to represent decision points.\n\n3. **Paths**:\n   - **`A --> B`**: Indicates a directional flow from node A to node B.\n   - **`C -->|Yes| D`**: Represents a flow from the decision node C to node D when the decision is \"Yes\". The label \"Yes\" is added along the path.\n   - **`C -->|No| E`**: Represents a flow from C to E when the decision is \"No\".\n\n4. **Ending**:\n   - Nodes `D` and `E` both lead to a final node `F[End]`, indicating the end of the flowchart.\n\nThis Mermaid syntax results in a flowchart that visually represents a process starting at \"Start\", moving to \"Process 1\", then reaching a decision point. Depending on the decision (\"Yes\" or \"No\"), the flow moves to either \"Process 2A\" or \"Process 2B\", respectively, before reaching the \"End\".\n\nMermaid diagrams can be included in Markdown files, documentation, and various tools that support Mermaid syntax, offering a convenient way to document workflows, processes, and system architectures.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"CODE\", \"code\": \"<html>\\n  <head>\\n    <title>Chew dad's slippers</title>\\n  </head>\\n  <body>\\n    <h1>\\n      Instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from\\n      the toilet\\n    </h1>\\n    <h2>Chase the red dot</h2>\\n    <p>\\n      Munch, munch, chomp, chomp hate dogs.

However, there are several issues and bugs in the code that need to be addressed:\n\n1. In the `openAcc` function, there are typos in the variable names `sql` and `sq2`. They should be `sql1` and `sql2` respectively.\n2. The `main` function is being called recursively, which can lead to a stack overflow if the user keeps entering options. It's better to use a loop instead.\n3. The `closeac` function has the same typo issue as the `openAcc` function.\n4. There is no error handling for database operations, which means if something goes wrong, the program will crash.\n5. The `balance` and `dispacc` functions are very similar. It seems like `dispacc` should display more information than just the balance.\n6. The `witham` function does not check if the account has enough balance to withdraw the requested amount.\n7. The database connection is opened at the start of the script and is never explicitly closed. It's good practice to close connections when they are no longer needed.\n\nHere's a revised version of the code with corrections and improvements:\n\n```python\nimport mysql.connector as a\n\ndef connect_to_db():\n    return a.connect(host=\"localhost\", user=\"root\", passwd=\"krish@123\", database=\"bank\")\n\ndef openAcc(con):\n    n = input(\"Enter Name:\")\n    ac = input(\"Enter Account No:\")\n    db = input(\"Enter D.O.B:\")\n    p = input(\"Enter Phone No.:\")\n    ad = input(\"Enter Address:\")\n    ob = int(input(\"Enter Opening Balance:\"))\n    data1 = (n, ac, db, p, ad, ob)\n    data2 = (n, ac, ob)\n    sql1 = 'insert into account Values(%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s)'\n    sql2 = 'insert into amount Values(%s,%s,%s)'\n    c = con.cursor()\n    c.execute(sql1, data1)\n    c.execute(sql2, data2)\n    con.commit()\n    print(\"Data Entered Successfully\")\n\n# Other functions should be updated similarly, including proper error handling and checking for sufficient balance in witham.\n\ndef main():\n    con = connect_to_db()\n    try:\n        while True:\n            print(\"\"\"\n            1. OPEN NEW ACCOUNT\n            2. DEPOSIT AMOUNT\n            3. WITHDRAW AMOUNT\n            4. BALANCE ENQUIRY\n            5. DISPLAY CUSTOMER DETAILS\n            6. CLOSE AN ACCOUNT\n            \"\"\")\n            choice = input(\"Enter Task No:\")\n            if choice == '1':\n                openAcc(con)\n            elif choice == '2':\n                depoAmo(con)\n            # ... other elif clauses for different choices\n            else:\n                print(\"Wrong choice.......\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n    finally:\n        con.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nRemember to update the other functions (`depoAmo`, `witham`, `balance`, `dispacc`, `closeac`) with the correct logic, error handling, and to pass the `con` parameter for the database connection. Also, ensure that the database schema matches the SQL queries in the code.\n\n# Metadata\n[]\n\n# Your output",

Take boots, for example. He earned $38 a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost $50. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of O.K. for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about $10. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford $50 had a pair of boots that\\u2019d still be keeping his feet dry in 10 years\\u2019 time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

In the process, they have been asserting various forms of Indigenous nationhood. This article argues that this development involves a common set of activities on the part of Indigenous peoples: (1) identifying as a nation or a people (determining who the appropriate collective \\u201cself\\u201d is in self-determination and self-government); (2) organizing as a political body (not just as a corporate holder of assets); and (3) acting on behalf of Indigenous goals (asserting and exercising practical decision-making power and responsibility, even in cases where central governments deny recognition). The article compares these activities in the four countries and argues that, while contexts and circumstances differ, the Indigenous politics of self-government show striking commonalities across the four. Among those commonalities: it is a positional as opposed to a distributional politics; while not ignoring individual welfare, it measures success in terms of collective power; and it focuses less on what central governments are willing to do in the way of recognition and rights than on what Indigenous nations or communities can do for themselves.

Almost everyone reading this article probably lives in a modern nation-state. In our contemporary environment, the state is something substantive, it is a physical manifestation of the abstract that is a country. It is an absolute and from it emanates authority and power. However, this is largely a nineteenth and early twentieth century perspective epitomized by Max Weber\\u2019s concept that the state is \\u201ca human community that claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory\\u201d (Weber 1946, p. 78). A more complicated and nuanced approach to the state has been going on in disciplines outside of history, such as anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology. Much of this has not been adopted by scholars nor filtered into our theoretical approaches in ancient studies.

After the period of the great migrations and the fall of the Western Empire, other states were created outside the limes, in the areas settled by German tribes, lying immediately to the east of the Rhine, and to the north of the Danube. Outside the limes, the transformation of tribal organizations into state ones was carried out through accumulation of power in the hands of tribal chiefs (kings, dukes) and taking over the state models from the outside. This became possible when local agriculture, animal breeding, handicraft and trade had created an economic basis indispensable for the political transformation. The geographic and ethnical proximity of the lands lying immediately outside the limes to the territories of the former Western Empire, and later to the barbarian successor states, favoured economic development and facilitated takeover of political models. Another variant of pattern diffusion was military conquest and the imposition of new patterns by force, as was the case with the Saxons (Kr\\u00fcger 1963; Werner 1979; Wolfram 1995).  In Central and Eastern Europe, settled by Slavic tribes, as well as in Scandinavia, settled by German tribes, emergence of states through transformation of tribal organizations occurred later, in the 9th \\u2013 11th centuries, which followed first of all from their geographical distance from the existing states of the Western and Southern Europe (Gieysztor and Manteuffel 1968; Foote and Wilson 1973; Gli Slavi 1983; Urba\\u0144czyk 1997; Lozny 2004). As a result, both the external models of state organization and the military pressure made themselves felt there later than in case of the lands directly outside the limes. Because of the lower effectiveness of the economies of Central, Eastern and Northern Europe, as well as their smaller demographic potential, the possibilities of internal political development and adoption of external models appeared there in the 9th \\u2013 11th centuries only. However, as soon as such possibilities came into being, states were created relatively fast in that area of Europe.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"State and Tribe in the History of Medieval Europe and Black Africa \\u2013 a Comparative Approach\", \"url\": \"https://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/140560/\", \"content\": \"If Christianity was rejected, adoption of the model became impossible, and military pressure left no time for the development of a local system.

The diffusion of this model of state organizations in Europe did not leave any room for the survival of tribal organizations. Traditional European historiography viewed this phenomenon as obvious, and saw the emergence of the state process as a one-way, unavoidable process of development.  However, the development of the state in Black Africa shows that another model of political transformation, different from the European one, is also possible. Africa has been one of the centres of political anthropological research since the 1930s. Meyer Fortes and Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard introduced into the political anthropology of Africa the following distinction:  ...the political systems described in this book fall into two main categories. One group, which we refer to as Group A, consists of those societies which have centralized authority, administrative machinery, and judicial institutions \\u2013 in short, a government \\u2013 and in which cleavages of wealth, privilege, and status correspond to the distribution of power and authority.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"State and Tribe in the History of Medieval Europe and Black Africa \\u2013 a Comparative Approach\", \"url\": \"https://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/140560/\", \"content\": \"In this way, the process of covering the whole area of Europe with state organizations progressed at the cost of tribal organizations, and lasted from the 5th until the late 13th century. Hence the successive stages during which the whole of Europe was covered with state organizations exploited the possibilities and the demographic, economic and organizational potential created by tribes. However, the emergence of states was   a fundamental, deep transformation. It was brought about by external pressure (Tilly 1990: 38\\u201347), but also by the attraction of the external state models. Adoption of the model was tantamount to the adoption of Christianity, which legitimized the political order of the state. If Christianity was rejected, adoption of the model became impossible, and military pressure left no time for the development of a local system.

Although immunocompetent individuals control tachyzoite-stage parasites during acute infection, the parasite survives indefinitely by forming dormant bradyzoites within tissue cysts residing in the brain and other tissues during chronic infection. When host immunity wanes, such as in patients receiving an organ transplant, chemotherapy, or those with untreated HIV/AIDS, the infection reactivates, causing lifethreatening disease. Individuals infected congenitally also experience significant disease at birth or later in life (1). Toxoplasma parasites are adept at invading and replicating within a wide variety of warm-blooded animal cells (2). Toxoplasma tachyzoites invaginate the host plasma membrane during invasion to create a safe intracellular niche, the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) (3). Parasites constitutively secrete dense granule (GRA) proteins into the PV, including some that help to form a network of tubule-like structures called the intravacuolar network (IVN) (4,5). The IVN has been proposed to facilitate the uptake of resources from the host cell.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Why Parasites May Not Be All That Bad\", \"url\": \"https://www.seeker.com/why-parasites-may-not-be-all-that-bad-1791574238.html\", \"content\": \"How can it get worse than little tiny worms or something feeding on your insides? \\\" Watch More: App Diagnoses Malaria: http://testtube.com/dnews/dnews-455-app-malaria Future of Pollution: http://testtube.com/stufftheydontwantyoutoknow/pollution-digging-deeper  \"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Why Parasites May Not Be All That Bad\", \"url\": \"https://www.seeker.com/why-parasites-may-not-be-all-that-bad-1791574238.html\", \"content\": \"They're all horrible, right?

You will then be given an unknown number of names to query your phone book for. For each  queried, print the associated entry from your phone book on a new line in the form name=phoneNumber; if an entry for  is not found, print Not found instead.\n\nNote: Your phone book should be a Dictionary/Map/HashMap data structure.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of entries in the phone book.\nEach of the  subsequent lines describes an entry in the form of  space-separated values on a single line. The first value is a friend's name, and the second value is an -digit phone number.\n\nAfter the  lines of phone book entries, there are an unknown number of lines of queries. Each line (query) contains a  to look up, and you must continue reading lines until there is no more input.\n\nNote: Names consist of lowercase English alphabetic letters and are first names only.\n\nConstraints\n\nOutput Format\n\nOn a new line for each query, print Not found if the name has no corresponding entry in the phone book; otherwise, print the full  and  in the format name=phoneNumber.\n\nSample Input\n\n3\nsam 99912222\ntom 11122222\nharry 12299933\nsam\nedward\nharry\nSample Output\n\nsam=99912222\nNot found\nharry=12299933\nExplanation\n\nWe add the following  (Key,Value) pairs to our map so it looks like this:\n\n\nWe then process each query and print key=value if the queried  is found in the map; otherwise, we print Not found.\n\nQuery 0: sam\nSam is one of the keys in our dictionary, so we print sam=99912222.\n\nQuery 1: edward\nEdward is not one of the keys in our dictionary, so we print Not found.\n\nQuery 2: harry\nHarry is one of the keys in our dictionary, so we print harry=12299933.\n\n# Answer\nAnswer generation was manually stopped.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"How do you...?\", \"url\": \"http://www.appinventor.org/content/howDoYou/ListNav\", \"content\": \"\\tHow do you step through a list of information where the steps are initiated by the user? \\t Example 1.

This behavior is similar to that of extension functions, which also allow you to access the members of the receiver object inside the function body. Here is an example of a function literal with receiver along with its type, where plus is called on the receiver object: val sum: Int. (Int) -> Int = { other -> plus(other) }  The anonymous function syntax allows you to specify the receiver type of a function literal directly. This can be useful if you need to declare a variable of a function type with receiver, and then to use it later. val sum = fun Int.

For decades now in my on-site hospitality training workshops, I often ask participants to work in small groups and to formulate one collective definition. Their results are always interesting and insightful, but the best one yet came out of a group many years ago that came up with this definition: \\u201cHospitality means caring about, as well as for, others.\\u201d  In the hotel industry, when we care \\u201cfor\\u201d others, we basically do our jobs and provide guest service. We clean the rooms, fix what is broken, and provide a room key in exchange for their credit card. Yet when we care \\u201cabout\\u201d our guests, we understand that the person on the other side of the desk, counter, phone call, or email exchange is a real person going through a uniquely personal travel experience. We take time to imagine that they might be in town for a wedding, a birthday, or a vacation, but also it might be for a funeral, memorial service, or at the start or end of a hospital stay. They might be in town on business to entertain sales prospects at fancy restaurants, hire new staff, or attend company meetings, but also it might be to testify in a lawsuit, close a branch office, or finalize a divorce proceeding. Those who have enrolled their front desk staff in KTN\\u2019s \\u201cCertified in the Heart of Hospitality\\u201d program will recognize another definition of hospitality we use, which is \\u201cHospitality is the delivery of human kindness, especially to strangers.\\u201d \"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Do Your Hotel Leaders Truly Understand The Difference Between \\u201cHospitality\\u201d and \\u201cGuest Service?\\u201d\", \"url\": \"https://www.hospitalitynet.org/opinion/4118565.html\", \"content\": \"Understanding the difference, and being able to convey this to frontline staff, are essential for taking both to the next level at your hotel, company or resort.

Foundationally, this requires providing safe, clean, updated, and comfortable accommodations. On top of that, excellent guest service requires using communications essentials that rise above merely being polite. A few examples would be: Holding eye contact with guests long enough to exchange smiles. Excellence in telephone communications. Using guest names conversationally throughout their stay.

The size and complexity of a hotel management organizational structure varies significantly depending on the size, features, and function of the hotel or resort. A small hotel operation normally may consist of a small core management team consisting of a Hotel Manager and a few key department supervisors who directly handle day-to-day operations. On the other hand, a large full-service hotel or resort complex often operates more similarly to a large corporation with an executive board headed by the General Manager and consisting of key directors serving as heads of individual hotel departments.

The common workplace environment in hotels is fast-paced, with high levels of interaction with guests, employees, investors, and other managers.  Upper management consisting of senior managers, department heads, and General Managers may sometimes enjoy a more desirable work schedule consisting of a more traditional business day with occasional weekends and holidays off.  Depending on the size of the hotel, a typical hotel manager's day may include assisting with operational duties, managing employee performance, handling dissatisfied guests, managing work schedules, purchasing supplies, interviewing potential job candidates, conducting physical walks and inspections of the hotel facilities and public areas, and additional duties. These duties may vary each day depending on the needs of the property. The manager's responsibility also includes knowing about all current local events as well as the events being held on the hotel property. Managers are often required to attend regular department meetings, management meetings, training seminars for professional development, and additional functions.

The hotel's General Manager is often supported by subordinate department managers that are responsible for individual departments and key functions of the hotel operation. The size and complexity of a hotel management organizational structure varies significantly depending on the size, features, and function of the hotel or resort. A small hotel operation normally may consist of a small core management team consisting of a Hotel Manager and a few key department supervisors who directly handle day-to-day operations. On the other hand, a large full-service hotel or resort complex often operates more similarly to a large corporation with an executive board headed by the General Manager and consisting of key directors serving as heads of individual hotel departments. Each department at the large hotel or resort complex may normally consist of subordinate line-level managers and supervisors who handle day-to-day operations.  Assistant Director of Housekeeping or Executive Housekeeper  Director of Revenue Management or Revenue Manager  Additional Management Positions may exist for additional facilities such as hotel-owned golf courses, casinos, or spas.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Hospitality industry - Wikipedia\", \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality_industry\", \"content\": \"canteens, concession stands, prepared food (e.g., in airports and sports arenas), contract feeding, dairy bars, diners, dining rooms, dinner theaters, food bars, frozen custard stands, grills, hamburger stands, hot dog stands, ice cream stands, industrial feeding, institutional food service such as that aboard airplanes, railroads, and ships), lunch bars, lunch counters, luncheonettes, lunchrooms, oyster bars, pizza parlors and pizzerias, refreshment stands, sandwich bars or shops, snack shops, soda fountains, soft drink stands, submarine sandwich shops, and tearooms.

It reviews the consultations between the outgoing Spanish bishops and the Vatican\\u2019s Apostolic Delegate, Placido Chapelle, in January 1900, and the subsequent religious settlement promulgated in the Vatican\\u2019s Apostolic Constitution for the Philippine Church, Quae mari Sinico, in 1902. The Delegate\\u2019s identification with the Spanish bishops and their opposition to Filipino nationalist aspirations and the Filipino secular clergy confirmed the anti-Filipino position of the Church in the American colonial period. Both the Filipino bishops and the American bishops opposed independence and distrusted the nationalist leaders as anti-clerical Masons. This is followed by a discussion of the claimed reconciliation of Church and Filipino political aspirations in the post-Vatican II period in the 1960s, which culminated in the Church\\u2019s role in bringing down President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986. Committed to a theology of social justice, the bishops now aligned the Church with progressive democratic nationalists.

You have to find and return the result according to following conditions: If n = 1, then 'percent' is discount percentage, calculate the marked price and return the same. If n = 2, then 'percent' is profit percentage, calculate the cost price and return the same.\nMarked Price = (Selling Price \u00d7 100) / (100 - discount %) Cost Price = (Selling Price \u00d7 100) / (100 + profit %)\nOutput will always be an integer i.e numerator will be factor of denominator\nsp > 0, profit %> 0 and discount % > 0\nn> 0 and n < 3\nAssumptions:\nExample:\nInput:\nn: 1\npercent: 20\nsp: 200\nOutput:\n250\nExplanation:\nSince n = 1, Marked Price (200 x 100) / (100-20) = 250, thus output is 250.\nSample input\nn: 2\npercent: 40\nsp: 140\nSample Output\n100\nInstructions:\nThis is a template based question, DO NOT write the \"main\" function.\nYour code is Judged by an automated system, do not write any additional welcome/greeting messages.\n\"Save and Test\" only checks for basic test cases, more rigorous cases will be used to judge your code while scoring.\nAdditional score will be given for writing optimized code both in terms of memory and execution time. Code in python language\n\n# Answer\nThe task requires implementing a function named `MarkedorCostPrice` that takes three integers `n`, `percent`, and `sp` as arguments. The function should calculate and return the marked price or cost price based on the given conditions.\n\nHere's the code in Python:\n\n```python\ndef MarkedorCostPrice(n, percent, sp):\n    if n == 1:\n        marked_price = (sp * 100) / (100 - percent)\n        return int(marked_price)\n    elif n == 2:\n        cost_price = (sp * 100) / (100 + percent)\n        return int(cost_price)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- If `n` is equal to 1, it means we need to calculate the marked price. We use the formula `(sp * 100) / (100 - percent)` to calculate the marked price and return it as an integer.\n- If `n` is equal to 2, it means we need to calculate the cost price. We use the formula `(sp * 100) / (100 + percent)` to calculate the cost price and return it as an integer.\n\nPlease note that the code assumes the given inputs are valid and within the specified range.\n\nYou can test the code with the provided sample input to verify its correctness.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"AOC2022/part2.py at main \\u00b7 mitiko/AOC2022\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/Mitiko/AOC2022/blob/main/day21/part2.py\", \"content\": \"To review, open the file in an editor that reveals hidden Unicode characters.

        "prompt": "# Question\nHow does a mutex work?\n\n# Answer\nA mutex, short for \"mutual exclusion\", is a synchronization primitive used to protect shared resources from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads, which could lead to race conditions or inconsistent state of data. Here's a basic overview of how a mutex works:\n\n- **Locking**: When a thread wants to access a shared resource, it attempts to \"lock\" the mutex associated with that resource. If the mutex is already locked by another thread, the requesting thread is blocked until the mutex becomes available.\n  \n- **Critical Section**: The section of the code that accesses the shared resource is often referred to as the \"critical section\". Only one thread can execute the critical section at a time, ensured by the mutex lock.\n  \n- **Unlocking**: Once the thread has finished its operation on the shared resource within the critical section, it \"unlocks\" the mutex. This action releases the mutex and allows other waiting threads to acquire the lock and enter the critical section.\n\n- **Atomic Operations**: The locking and unlocking operations are atomic, meaning they are executed as a single, indivisible operation. This ensures that the state of the mutex is always consistent.\n\n- **Avoiding Deadlocks**: Care must be taken to avoid deadlocks, which can occur if multiple mutexes are locked in an inconsistent order across threads. \n\nHere's a simplified example in pseudo-code to illustrate the use of a mutex:\n\n```c\n// Pseudo-code for mutex usage\n\n// Initialize a mutex\nMutex mutex;\n\nfunction accessSharedResource() {\n    // Lock the mutex before accessing the shared resource\n    mutex.lock();\n    \n    // Critical section: code that accesses shared resource goes here\n    \n    // Unlock the mutex after accessing the shared resource\n    mutex.unlock();\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `mutex.lock()` ensures that only one thread can enter the critical section at a time. Any other thread that calls `accessSharedResource()` will be blocked at `mutex.lock()` until the mutex is unlocked by the current owner. This mechanism prevents race conditions and ensures the integrity of the shared resource.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Go (Golang) Mutex Tutorial with Examples - golangbot.com\", \"url\": \"https://golangbot.com/mutex/\", \"content\": \"This section of code that modifies shared resources is called critical section.

Notice how the shared counter (count) increases with each operation, regardless of which thread is executing, while the individual counters (count_thread1 and count_thread2) are incremented only by their respective threads. When transitioning to Rust from a language like Go, one thing you might find familiar is the verbosity in error handling. Rust, much like Go, emphasizes explicit and clear error management, though the styles differ slightly. Let's delve into how this plays out in Rust using our example, and why embracing this verbosity can be beneficial. In summary, Rust's approach to error handling, while verbose, shares similarities with Go's explicit style. This verbosity is a small price to pay for the clarity and safety it brings to your code. As you grow more accustomed to Rust's patterns, you'll find that this explicitness becomes an invaluable tool in writing reliable, bug-resistant applications.

Expected Outcomes: As each thread performs its operations, we expect the shared counter (count) to be incremented by both threads, whereas count_thread1 and count_thread2 are exclusive to their respective threads. The threads also print out the current state of these counters after each increment. In summary, Arc in our main function demonstrates Rust's powerful and safe approach to concurrency. By allowing multiple threads to share ownership of data, Arc enables concurrent access while ensuring that the data lives as long as it's needed and no longer.

So what is a mutex? At its core, it allows you to ensure that only one goroutine has access to a block of code at a time, with all other goroutines attempting to access the same code having to wait until the mutex has been unlocked before proceeding. Let\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s look at a quick example: var mu sync.Mutex  In this example, if two goroutines call the add function, only one can proceed at a time. When Lock is called on the mutex, it ensures that no other goroutine can access the same block until Unlock is called. Race Conditions So why does this matter? The primary purpose of a mutex is to prevent race conditions, whereby two or more goroutines access and/or modify the same state with varying outcomes based on the order of execution. Let\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s take a look at an example: package main   Note: You can safely ignore the WaitGroup logic here, it is simply there to ensure that we wait for the goroutines to complete before the program exits.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Tutorial: Synchronizing State with Mutexes in Go\", \"url\": \"https://kylewbanks.com/blog/tutorial-synchronizing-state-with-mutexes-golang\", \"content\": \" This also applies when the same mutex is used for multiple variables, like so: type Processor struct {  By defining the mutex directly above the variable(s) it relates to, we are signalling to other developers that the mutex is used to protect access to these variables. Deferred Unlocks In more complex software than the trivial examples above, where the function that calls Lock has various places to return, or the entire function must be locked, it is common to use a defer to ensure Unlock is called prior to the function returning, like so: func process() {  This ensures that no matter what branch the code takes inside the function, Unlock will always be called. As a bonus, developers can add code to the function without worrying that they may miss a case where Unlock must be called. Deadlocks Forgetting to Unlock It is absolutely crucial to call Unlock! If you don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t all other goroutines will wait indefinitely for the Unlock call, meaning they will never proceed and the program will grind to a halt.

So what happened? We can see in the sample output above that the E and A goroutines ran properly, but we started getting into trouble around D. This is because the goroutines can\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t finish fast enough before the next routine begins, and a data race begins where each goroutine is modifying the sum value at the same time.

        "prompt": "# Question\nCan you write code to a chrome extension that monitors web traffic? mainly POST requests\n\n# Answer\nSure! Here's an example code snippet for a Chrome extension that monitors web traffic, specifically POST requests:\n\n```javascript\n// background.js\n\n// Create a listener for web requests\nchrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(\n  function(details) {\n    // Check if the request method is POST\n    if (details.method === \"POST\") {\n      // Log the URL of the POST request\n      console.log(\"POST request URL:\", details.url);\n      \n      // You can also access the request body if needed\n      console.log(\"POST request body:\", details.requestBody);\n    }\n  },\n  { urls: [\"<all_urls>\"] },\n  [\"requestBody\"]\n);\n```\n\nIn this code, we're using the `chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest` event listener to capture all web requests. We then check if the request method is POST and log the URL and request body if it is.\n\nTo use this code, you'll need to create a Chrome extension and include this code in the background script (`background.js`). Make sure to declare the necessary permissions in the `manifest.json` file, such as `\"webRequest\"` and `\"webRequestBlocking\"`.\n\nPlease note that this code will only capture POST requests that are made after the extension is installed and running. It won't capture POST requests that were made before the extension was installed or requests that are made in incognito mode.\n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance!\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"chrome.webRequest\", \"url\": \"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/webRequest/\", \"content\": \"Indicates if this response was fetched from disk cache.

        "prompt": "# Question\nWhat is the purpose of replacing 'eins Uhr' with 'ein Uhr' in the resulting German time string?\n\n# Answer\nThe purpose of replacing 'eins Uhr' with 'ein Uhr' in the resulting German time string is to ensure grammatical correctness. In German, the word \"eins\" (meaning \"one\") changes to \"ein\" when used before the word \"Uhr\" (meaning \"hour\") to indicate the time as \"one o'clock\". This is a grammatical rule in German.\n\nBy replacing 'eins Uhr' with 'ein Uhr', the code snippet ensures that the resulting German time string follows the correct grammar. It provides a more accurate and natural representation of the time in the colloquial variant.\n\nIt's worth noting that this replacement is specific to the colloquial variant of the time. The official variant, which is also included in the return value of the `convert_time_to_german` function, does not undergo this replacement.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Basic German: Telling Time - dummies\", \"url\": \"https://www.dummies.com/article/academics-the-arts/language-language-arts/learning-languages/german/basic-german-telling-time-163055/\", \"content\": \" Wie sp\\u00c3\\u00a4t ist es?

        "prompt": "# Question\nwhat is a mutex\n\n# Answer\nA mutex, short for mutual exclusion, is a synchronization mechanism used in multi-threaded programming to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource or a critical section of code at a time. It is used to prevent data races and ensure thread safety.\n\nHere are some key points about mutexes:\n\n- A mutex has two states: locked and unlocked. Only one thread can hold the lock at a time.\n- When a thread wants to access a shared resource or a critical section of code, it first tries to acquire the mutex lock. If the lock is already held by another thread, the requesting thread will be blocked until the lock becomes available.\n- Once a thread acquires the mutex lock, it can safely access the shared resource or execute the critical section of code.\n- When the thread is done with the shared resource or critical section, it releases the mutex lock, allowing other threads to acquire it.\n- Mutexes provide mutual exclusion, ensuring that multiple threads do not interfere with each other or access the shared resource simultaneously.\n- Mutexes can be implemented using various techniques, such as hardware instructions, operating system primitives, or programming language constructs.\n- Proper use of mutexes is essential to prevent race conditions and ensure thread safety in multi-threaded programs.\n\nExample usage of a mutex in C++:\n\n```cpp\n#include <mutex>\n\nstd::mutex mtx; // Creating a mutex object\n\nvoid sharedResourceAccess()\n{\n    mtx.lock(); // Acquiring the mutex lock\n\n    // Accessing the shared resource or critical section of code\n\n    mtx.unlock(); // Releasing the mutex lock\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `std::mutex` class from the C++ standard library is used to create a mutex object named `mtx`. The `lock()` function is used to acquire the mutex lock before accessing the shared resource or critical section of code, and the `unlock()` function is used to release the lock afterward.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Mutual Exclusion\", \"url\": \"https://wiki.osdev.org/Mutual_Exclusion\", \"content\": \" Suppose multiple threads have to access the same file.

It's basically some CPU instructions that inform a CPU that a region of code should not be accessed for a while.   Did you also know that it's possible to design your algorithm in a way that it might use shared memory, and yet not need to use mutexes? Typically, such instructions are processed in such a way that a group of load and store instructions are executed atomically (transactional memory). This is achieved by using hardware intrinsic atomic operations.

        "prompt": "# Question\ncan you loose coupling to kid\n\n# Answer\nExplaining loose coupling to a kid can be done in a simple and relatable way:\n\n- **Imagine a LEGO Toy Set**: \n  - Loose coupling is like playing with LEGO blocks. Each block is a different piece of the toy, and they can be easily connected or disconnected.\n  - Just like in LEGO, the pieces are not permanently glued together. You can swap pieces or add new ones without breaking the toy.\n\n- **Playing with Different Toys**:\n  - Loose coupling is like playing with different toys that can work together. Each toy does its part, and they can play together without being stuck together.\n  - For example, a toy car can be driven by different action figures without changing the car itself.\n\n- **Sharing Toys with Friends**:\n  - Loose coupling is like sharing toys with friends. You can lend a toy to a friend, and they can play with it without needing all your toys.\n  - Similarly, in loose coupling, components can work together without knowing all the details about each other.\n\n- **Building a Playhouse**:\n  - Loose coupling is like building a playhouse with different rooms. Each room serves a different purpose, but they are connected by doors.\n  - If you want to change or add a room, you can do so without affecting the other rooms.\n\nIn essence, loose coupling is about keeping things flexible and independent, just like how kids play with different toys that can work together or separately without being permanently attached.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"RHo (Rita Ho)User\", \"url\": \"https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/RHo/\", \"content\": \"  @RHo I have a design question about the (Show IP) buttons: In the screenshots they are styled like links, but they behave as buttons. They don't navigate to another page like links; instead they fetch some data and update the appearance of the page when clicked. Technically it's a bit awkward to do this. We can make a button using the UI component library, and tell it what to do when a user clicks. But to style this to look like a link would take a lot of custom CSS, which can end up being fragile. For me, whenever we seem to be fighting the component library it raises the question: should we be doing this (i.e. should we be styling a button to look like a link)? Do we have any style guidelines about whether the user should be able to distinguish a link from a button by their appearance?

Likewise, if you, like many project managers skip the closure phase of the project management life cycle, you could risk making similar mistakes in future projects by not learning and reviewing your mistakes.. Life Cycle Phase I: Initiation of the Project Before you can get to planning a project, the project has to be initiated. Project initiation consists of the following steps:  Create a document outlining the product or project. This initial document is informal compared to the project charter. It simply describes what will be created or what the overall goal is of the project. A project feasibility report will need to be completed. Before investing too much time in a project, you must check to see whether or not it is feasible that you will be able to complete the project, product, or process with the available resources. Once you have determined the project is feasible, then a project manager and team will be assigned to the project. The project scope statement is the next deliverable. This deliverable outlines what will be done (the project scope), how it will be done, and why it will be done.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Project Management Life Cycle - What are the Different Stages of a Project?\", \"url\": \"https://www.brighthubpm.com/project-planning/65203-the-project-life-cycle/\", \"content\": \"It simply describes what will be created or what the overall goal is of the project.

Life Cycle Phase II: Planning the Project Once the project has been approved, a deadline has been set, and the scope has been agreed upon, then the project planning phase of the project management life cycle begins. The project planning phase consists of the following steps:  Review the project scope and revise the scope statement if necessary. You want to keep your project from entering a phenomenon known as \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cscope creep\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d where the scope of the project grows or expands without making necessary changes to the budget or schedule of the project.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Project Management Life Cycle - What are the Different Stages of a Project?\", \"url\": \"https://www.brighthubpm.com/project-planning/65203-the-project-life-cycle/\", \"content\": \"Perform a risk assessment.

Project monitoring & controlling stage: track project progress, identify any deviations and make necessary adjustments  The monitoring and controlling stage of a project is a critical phase that ensures project activities align with the predetermined objectives and milestones.  During this phase, project managers and stakeholders closely oversee project progress, assess performance and make necessary adjustments to keep the project on track.  Effective monitoring and controlling practices are essential for mitigating risks, identifying potential issues and ensuring the project\\u2019s timely completion within the allocated budget.  During the monitoring and controlling stage of a project, the key project management steps include:   Measure and assess the project\\u2019s progress against the project plan and key performance indicators.  Identify and manage potential risks that could impact project objectives, and implement strategies to mitigate these risks.

Maintain open lines of communication with stakeholders, keeping them informed about the project\\u2019s progress and addressing any concerns or issues promptly.  Identify and address any project issues or conflicts that may arise, aiming to resolve them efficiently to prevent delays or disruptions.  Create a quality control checklist to maintain consistent quality standards throughout the project lifecycle  To systematically evaluate each deliverable against established quality benchmarks can take a lot of time. A great tip for project managers is to use a quality control checklist to quickly identify any deviations or discrepancies and take corrective actions to maintain the overall quality of the project. Quality control checklists help in maintaining consistent quality standards throughout the project. By defining specific quality criteria, project managers can ensure that all deliverables meet the same level of quality, thereby enhancing the overall project integrity and customer satisfaction.\"}]\n\n# Your output",

Here is a breakdown of each function:\n\n1. `setActiveModel()`: This function sets the active model for a device type. It first creates a copy of the current state using the spread operator (`...this.state`). Then, it checks if the active device type has any models. If it does, it iterates over each model and sets the `selected` property to `false`. After that, it sets the `activeModel` property of the state to the models array and sets the `selected` property of the active model to `true`. Finally, it updates the component state using `this.setState()`.\n\n2. `handleChange(e)`: This function handles the change event for form inputs. It first creates a copy of the current state using the spread operator (`{ ...this.state }`). Then, it checks if the event parameter (`e`) is not a string. If it's not a string, it assumes that it's an event object and updates the corresponding property in the `OTAform` object of the state with the new value. It also clears any error message associated with the updated property. Finally, it updates the component state using `this.setState()`.\n\n3. `handleJobtype(e)`: This function handles the change event for the job type selection. If the event parameter (`e`) is not a string, it sets the `jobModel` property of the state to `true` and updates the `targetSelection` property with the selected value. This function uses an arrow function syntax to bind the `this` context correctly.\n\n4. `handleJobModelHide()`: This function hides the job model by setting the `jobModel` property of the state to `false` and restores the previous value of the `targetSelection` property.\n\n5. `updateTargetSelection()`: This function updates the target selection by setting the `jobModel` property of the state to `false` and updating the `temptargetSelection` property with the current value of the `targetSelection` property.\n\n6. `createOta()`: This function is called when creating an OTA (Over-The-Air) update. It first checks if the form inputs pass the validation by calling the `validationForm()` function. If the validation succeeds, it calls the `updateFirmware()` function.\n\n7. `validationForm()`: This function validates the form inputs for creating an OTA update. It checks if the `newFirmVer`, `desc`, and `jobTimeout` properties of the `OTAform` object in the state meet the required criteria. If any of the fields are invalid, it sets the corresponding error property in the `regErr` object of the state and returns `false`. Otherwise, it returns `true` indicating that all fields are valid.\n\n8. `isDisabled()`: This function checks if the form inputs and selected device/group meet the criteria for enabling the create OTA button. It checks if the `newFirmVer`, `desc`, `jobTimeout`, and either the selected device group or device list are empty. If any of these conditions are met, it returns `true` indicating that the button should be disabled. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\n9. `switchDeviceType(pType, index)`: This function is called when switching the active device type. It makes an asynchronous call to the `getDeviceType()` function with the `pType` parameter. Once the response is received, it creates a copy of the current state using the spread operator (`{ ...this.state }`). Then, it updates the `activeDeviceTypeName` and `activeDeviceType` properties of the state with the received values. It also resets the `nextDeviceToken`, `devicelistResult`, and calls the `setActiveModel()` function to update the active model. Finally, it updates the component state using `this.setState()`.\n\n### Payload and Response ###\n\nThe provided code does not include the implementation details of the functions `getDeviceType()` and `updateFirmware()`. Therefore, the payload and response of these functions cannot be determined from the given code.\n\n### End User Perspective ###\n\n#### Usability Flow ####\n\n1. Selecting an Active Model:\n   - The user can select an active model for a device type.\n   - The available models are determined by the selected device type.\n   - The user can only select one active model at a time.\n   - The selected active model will be highlighted.\n\n2. Handling Form Input Changes:\n   - The user can input values in the form fields.\n   - Any changes made in the form fields will trigger the `handleChange()` function.\n   - The input values will be stored in the component state.\n\n3. Selecting a Job Type:\n   - The user can select a job type from a dropdown menu.\n   - The selected job type will be stored in the component state.\n   - The selection will trigger the `handleJob\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Overview of React.js\", \"url\": \"https://www.patterns.dev/posts/reactjs/\", \"content\": \"Two things that are worth remembering about props; Firstly, we determine the value of a prop and use it as part of the blueprint before the component is built.

If the user is not a superuser, it simply returns the user name, otherwise it returns root (assuming that some operating system allows this).\n    formatHost :: EnvironmentM String -- reads the name of the device the user is running on from the environment and simply returns it.\n    formatCurrentDir :: EnvironmentM String -- reads from the environment and returns the name of the current folder.\n    formatPrompt :: EnvironmentM String -- returns an input prompt formatted according to the following pattern: {username}@{hostname}:{cwd}$, where username, hostname, cwd -- the username, device name, and working folder location, respectively, obtained from the environment. For superuser, root should be output as the username.\n\n# Answer\nTo implement the required functions in Haskell using the `Reader` monad, you can follow the structure below. Each function utilizes the `Reader` monad to access the `Environment` and extract the necessary information to format the command line prompt as specified.\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}\n\nimport Control.Monad.Reader\n\n-- Assuming the Environment data type and EnvironmentM type alias are defined as mentioned\ndata Environment = Environment\n  { username :: String\n  , isSuperUser :: Bool\n  , host :: String\n  , currentDir :: String\n  } deriving Eq\n\ntype EnvironmentM = Reader Environment\n\n-- Implementing the formatUserName function\nformatUserName :: EnvironmentM String\nformatUserName = do\n  env <- ask\n  return $ if isSuperUser env then \"root\" else username env\n\n-- Implementing the formatHost function\nformatHost :: EnvironmentM String\nformatHost = do\n  env <- ask\n  return $ host env\n\n-- Implementing the formatCurrentDir function\nformatCurrentDir :: EnvironmentM String\nformatCurrentDir = do\n  env <- ask\n  return $ currentDir env\n\n-- Implementing the formatPrompt function\nformatPrompt :: EnvironmentM String\nformatPrompt = do\n  user <- formatUserName\n  hostname <- formatHost\n  cwd <- formatCurrentDir\n  return $ user ++ \"@\" ++ hostname ++ \":\" ++ cwd ++ \"$\"\n\n-- Example usage\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  let env = Environment \"kilroy\" False \"sandbox\" \"/home/kilroy/places-where-i-have-been\"\n  putStrLn $ runReader formatPrompt env\n```\n\nThis code defines four functions (`formatUserName`, `formatHost`, `formatCurrentDir`, and `formatPrompt`) as per the requirements:\n\n- `formatUserName` checks if the user is a superuser and returns \"root\" if true, otherwise, it returns the username.\n- `formatHost` simply returns the host name from the environment.\n- `formatCurrentDir` returns the current directory from the environment.\n- `formatPrompt` combines the outputs of the other three functions to format the command line prompt as specified.\n\nThe `main` function is an example usage that creates an `Environment` instance and runs `formatPrompt` to generate and print a command line prompt.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Reader monad\", \"url\": \"https://davesquared.net/2012/08/reader-monad.html\", \"content\": \"We can import Control.Monad.Reader to make our showPerson examples compile without having to define the reader implementation ourselves.

Here are some key points based on the provided information:\n\n- **Ethical Considerations**: In international business trade, ethical considerations play a crucial role in shaping business practices, relationships, and outcomes. Ethical behavior is essential in maintaining trust, reputation, and long-term sustainability in global markets.\n\n- **Compliance and Regulations**: International business trade often involves navigating diverse legal and regulatory frameworks across different countries. Adhering to ethical standards and compliance with regulations is vital to avoid legal issues and maintain a positive reputation.\n\n- **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)**: Many companies engage in CSR initiatives as part of their international business trade activities. This includes promoting ethical labor practices, environmental sustainability, and community engagement in the countries where they operate.\n\n- **Transparency and Accountability**: Ethical behavior in international business trade requires transparency in dealings, accountability for actions, and a commitment to integrity. Companies that prioritize ethical practices are more likely to build strong relationships with stakeholders.\n\n- **Impact on Stakeholders**: Unethical behavior in international business trade can have negative consequences for various stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, and the local community. Upholding ethical standards is essential for protecting the interests of all stakeholders involved.\n\nThese points highlight the importance of ethics in international business trade and how ethical considerations can influence decision-making, relationships, and outcomes in the global marketplace.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Is Ethics in Business Possible?\", \"url\": \"https://www.industryweek.com/supply-chain-initiative/article/21120741/is-ethics-in-business-possible\", \"content\": \"And like with company culture, once you impose a revenue related relationship with what is supposed to be a partner, it\\u2019s difficult to re-establish collaboration.

Take a look at the current statistics on software piracy: In the United States, pirated software is estimated to be 35% of the total software market, and industry losses are estimated at $2.3 billion per year. The piracy rate is 57% in Germany and 80% in Italy and Japan; the rates in most Asian countries are estimated to be nearly 100%.    There are similar laws against software piracy in those countries. What, then, accounts for the differences? Although a country\\u2019s level of economic development plays a large part, culture, including ethical attitudes, may be a more crucial factor. The 1995 annual report of the Software Publishers Association connects software piracy directly to culture and attitude. It describes Italy and Hong Kong as having \\u201c\\u2018first world\\u2019 per capita incomes, along with \\u2018third world\\u2019 rates of piracy.\\u201d When asked whether one should use software without paying for it, most people, including people in Italy and Hong Kong, say no.

The notion of a right evolved with the rise of democracy in post-Renaissance Europe and the United States, but the term is not found in either Confucian or Buddhist traditions. We all learn ethics in the context of our particular cultures, and the power in the principles is deeply tied to the way in which they are expressed. Internationally accepted lists of moral principles, such as the United Nations\\u2019 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, draw on many cultural and religious traditions. As philosopher Michael Walzer has noted, \\u201cThere is no Esperanto of global ethics.\\u201d  The third problem with absolutism is the belief in a global standard of ethical behavior. Context must shape ethical practice. Very low wages, for example, may be considered unethical in rich, advanced countries, but developing nations may be acting ethically if they encourage investment and improve living standards by accepting low wages. Likewise, when people are malnourished or starving, a government may be wise to use more fertilizer in order to improve crop yields, even though that means settling for relatively high levels of thermal water pollution.  When cultures have different standards of ethical behavior\\u2014and different ways of handling unethical behavior\\u2014a company that takes an absolutist approach may find itself making a disastrous mistake.\"}]\n\n# Your output",

        "prompt": "# Question\nAre there any other mods or plugins that can help achieve a DOT effect in Minecraft?\n\n# Answer\nYes, there are several mods and plugins available that can help you achieve a DOT (Damage Over Time) effect in Minecraft. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Damage Indicators Mod: This mod adds health bars and damage indicators above mobs, allowing you to see the damage over time effect visually. It also provides options to customize the appearance and behavior of the indicators.\n\n2. EssentialsX Plugin: EssentialsX is a popular plugin for Bukkit/Spigot servers that adds various essential features, including the ability to create custom effects. Using the `/effect` command, you can create a custom effect with a duration and amplifier to simulate a DOT effect.\n\n3. Magic Spells Mod: This mod introduces a wide range of magical spells to Minecraft, including spells that can apply DOT effects to entities. You can customize the duration and intensity of the DOT effect using the mod's configuration options.\n\n4. Custom Plugins: If you have programming experience, you can create a custom plugin using a Minecraft plugin development framework like Bukkit or Sponge. This would allow you to have complete control over the implementation of the DOT effect and customize it to your specific needs.\n\nPlease note that the availability and compatibility of these mods and plugins may vary depending on the Minecraft version you are using. It's always recommended to check the mod/plugin documentation and ensure compatibility with your desired Minecraft version before installation.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need more specific assistance, feel free to ask.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Better Hurt Timer\", \"url\": \"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-hurt-timer\", \"content\": \" \\\"BHT is a mixin (ASM) tweaker mod for minecraft that aims to improve and balance the way damage affects PVP and PVE combat. \\\"   If you are experiencing difficulties (crashes / bugs / etc) consider using nodami instead!     * Before, combat was limited only to how much damage you were able to do in a single hit (implying it ever reaches the target), this not only limited combat options, but also team tactics during battles. * Now, not only DPS is important, but multiple damage sources can also play a role on damaging the enemy, and multiple people damage blocking an entity isn't a problem anymore. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 - Players and Mobs can only attack as fast as their attack speed, meaning a player can only hit within a threshold so click spamming with their fists won't do more damage per second than spamming with a sword on hand, players are encouraged to land their hits on time.  * Before, removing i-Frames or damage immunity meant losing your armor to fire and dying to lava instantaneously.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Better Hurt Timer\", \"url\": \"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-hurt-timer\", \"content\": \"\\\"   If you are experiencing difficulties (crashes / bugs / etc) consider using nodami instead!     * Before, combat was limited only to how much damage you were able to do in a single hit (implying it ever reaches the target), this not only limited combat options, but also team tactics during battles. * Now, not only DPS is important, but multiple damage sources can also play a role on damaging the enemy, and multiple people damage blocking an entity isn't a problem anymore. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 - Players and Mobs can only attack as fast as their attack speed, meaning a player can only hit within a threshold so click spamming with their fists won't do more damage per second than spamming with a sword on hand, players are encouraged to land their hits on time.  * Before, removing i-Frames or damage immunity meant losing your armor to fire and dying to lava instantaneously. * Now, damage that would otherwise apply every tick is either accumulated and released or canceled within damage type specific i-Frames.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"GitHub - WittyWhiscash/DamageOverhaul: A mod for Minecraft that overhauls damage calculations and creates a different damage experience.\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/WittyWhiscash/DamageOverhaul\", \"content\": \"As I find incompatibilities with this mod and others as raised through issues, I will mark them incompatible on my end.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"GitHub - WittyWhiscash/DamageOverhaul: A mod for Minecraft that overhauls damage calculations and creates a different damage experience.\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/WittyWhiscash/DamageOverhaul\", \"content\": \"Simply put though, it recalculates armor based on the amount of damage, and how spread out the damage is amongst typing.

Conventional wisdom is that the more liquidity, the better for traders, but that\\u2019s not always the case. The first factor to consider is slippage, or the difference between the price at which a buyer places a market order\\u2014and the price that they actually pay. In centralized exchanges, there are two reasons for slippage: market volatility\\u2014prices moving around\\u2014and insufficient order depth. In the latter case, there is just not enough volume to fill the entire order at the requested price, so part of it gets filled at a higher price. In DEXs, the concept of slippage is similar, but is simply a function of TVL. The other price factor to consider after slippage is fees. Capital always expects a return, so liquidity providers (LPs) who provide large amounts of TVL need to be paid yield. The more liquidity they provide, the more they need to be paid\\u2014and their fees are included in the user\\u2019s price.

The size of each liquidity pool within a DEX has a direct impact on the exchange\\u2019s fees. Generally, smaller pools incur lower fees but lead to more slippage. Conversely, larger pools require higher fees but result in less slippage. Crucially, the relationship is non-linear. For example, a $10,000 trade in a $10 million pool may have 10 basis points (bps) of slippage, plus fees to compensate LPs. The same $10,000 trade in a $1 billion pool has essentially zero slippage. But if trade volume is not significantly higher than in the $10 million pool, transaction fees would need to be much higher to generate a similar yield for LPs in a pool with 1,000 times the capital.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"The Problem with TVL, DeFi's Favorite Metric - Decrypt\", \"url\": \"https://decrypt.co/82024/problem-with-tvl-total-value-locked-defi-metric\", \"content\": \"Thus, more liquidity tends to hurt retail traders, who constitute the largest DeFi user base and generally place trades of less than $10,000. Why, then, do most DeFi projects seek to attract as much liquidity as possible? Most likely this is marketing: big numbers draw more eyeballs. That is not totally wrong-headed, as more liquidity does have the potential to attract more trade volume, which in turn could off-set the need to increase fees to meet the required yield. But this tends to hold true only up to a point. This is why our DEX Clipper, launched in July, has a liquidity pool capped at $20 million to be friendlier to retail traders. Of course, not every DEX should cater to retail traders, and high liquidity is not inherently a bad thing. But the DeFi community\\u2019s growing obsession with attaining the highest possible liquidity is adversely affecting the vast majority of its users. The resulting dynamic echoes one of the most problematic aspects of traditional finance, in which, for example, customers with relatively small checking accounts pay the fees that enable banks to offer free services and cut-rate mortgages to wealthy clients.

Here is a breakdown of the code:\n\n- **Model Definition**:\n  - Defines a `UserProfile` model with a one-to-one relationship to the `User` model. It includes a `webhook_url` field of type `URLField` with a default value set to `uuid4` and marked as not editable.\n\n- **Signal Receiver Function**:\n  - Decorates a function named `track_product_changes` with `@receiver(pre_save, sender=Product)`. This function is triggered before saving a `Product` instance.\n  - It compares the fields of the current `Product` instance with the existing instance to detect changes and generates a message text describing the changes.\n  - If changes are detected, it calls the `send_notification_to_user` function to send a notification to the user associated with the product.\n\n- **send_notification_to_user Function**:\n  - Defines a function `send_notification_to_user` responsible for sending a notification to the user about the product changes.\n  - Retrieves the `UserProfile` object associated with the user (in this case, user with `user_id=1`) to obtain the `webhook_url`.\n  - Constructs a payload containing the `product_id` and `message_text` and sends a POST request to the webhook URL using the `requests` library.\n\n- **Note**:\n  - The code assumes the existence of a `Product` model, which is not shown in the provided snippet.\n  - You may need to adjust the logic to retrieve the correct `UserProfile` based on the user associated with the product being changed.\n\nThis code snippet showcases a practical use case of Django signals for tracking changes in a model instance and sending notifications to users based on those changes.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Getting to know Django Signals\", \"url\": \"https://dev.to/ahmadsalah/getting-to-know-django-signals-39i9\", \"content\": \"And that's it!

This article presents a database logging solution inspired from the Observer Design Pattern, which uses Django signals, sent from various sources in a unified fashion. Let\\u2019s start with a possible use case. Our application uses Finite State Machines (FSMs) to handle the changes of a user\\u2019s state, which can be invited,\\u00a0active,\\u00a0locked or\\u00a0deactivated. Some of the changes from one state to another are done by users, such as activation from the invited state or the locking, in case they have entered wrong credentials too many times. Other changes may be done via an admin interface, such as activating, deactivating and unlocking a user. Finally the superadmin, using Django Admin views, can override any changes and set a user\\u2019s state at their will, regardless of the Finite State Machine\\u2019s rules. The purpose is that every time a user\\u2019s state is changed, we get a new line in our database table (user_state_audit\\u00a0) which records details about the user who was changed and the user who initiated the changes. For more information on implementing Finite State Machines in such projects, check out our previous article on the subject.

        "prompt": "# Question\nExplain using findstreetfunction\n\n# Answer\n\nThe `findStreetByIntersections` function in the [`plsql.sql`](plsql.sql#L650-L682) file takes a string as input and returns a string array. The string input represents a street name, and the function returns all the intersections that this street has with other streets.\n\nThis function is called from the Java application in the `Find` class located at [`src/main/java/org/example/DAO/Find.java`](src/main/java/org/example/DAO/Find.java#L72-L96). \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n```type:Quoted,lang:Java,path:src/main/java/org/example/DAO/Find.java,lines:72-96\npublic static void findStreetByIntersections(Connection connection) throws SQLException{\n        System.out.println(\"Street name: \");\n        String name = scanner.nextLine();\n        \n        CallableStatement callableStatement = connection.prepareCall(\"begin ? := findStreetByIntersections(?); end;\");\n        callableStatement.registerOutParameter(1, OracleTypes.ARRAY, \"STRING_ARRAY\");\n        callableStatement.setString(2, name);\n        callableStatement.execute();\n        \n        Array result = callableStatement.getArray(1);\n        \n        Object obj = result.getArray();\n        \n        Object [] objectArray = (Object []) obj;   // cast it to an array of objects\n        \n        StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer(\"\");\n        buffer.append(String.valueOf(objectArray[0]));\n        for (int j = 1; j &lt; objectArray.length; j++)\n        {\n            buffer.append(\"\\n\").append(String.valueOf(objectArray[j]));\n        }\n        System.out.println(buffer);\n    }\n```\n\n\nIn the Java application, it prompts the user to enter a street name. It then constructs a `CallableStatement` to call the `findStreetByIntersections` PL/SQL function with the entered street name as a parameter. The `callableStatement.execute()` call executes the function.\n\nThe function will return an array of intersections as an Oracle Array object. This object is then transformed into a plain Java array using the `result.getArray()` function. This plain array is then printed out as a list of strings. Each string represents an intersection that the entered street has with other streets.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"CODE\", \"code\": \"    public static void findStreetByIntersections(Connection connection) throws SQLException{\\n        System.out.println(\\\"Street name: \\\");\\n        String name = scanner.nextLine();\\n\\n        CallableStatement callableStatement = connection.prepareCall(\\\"begin ? := findStreetByIntersections(?);

We used ++ in our \\\"Guess the number\\\" game back in our first splash into JavaScript article, when we added 1 to our guessCount variable to keep track of how many guesses the user has left after each turn. Let's try playing with these in your console. For a start, note that you can't apply these directly to a number, which might seem strange, but we are assigning a variable a new updated value, not operating on the value itself. The following will return an error: So, you can only increment an existing variable. Try this: Okay, strangeness number 2!

Another important thing to solve this problem is to remember the rule of matrix multiplication in mathematics. If you don't remember the rule, just forget about how to solve this problem, unless you have access to Google. So, first, we'll refresh the rules of multiplication and then we'll look into the coding aspect.  A Matrix is nothing but a  two-dimensional array  of numbers. It has rows and columns, for example following matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns To multiply a matrix by a single number is easy, just multiply each element of a matrix with that number is known a scalar multiplication.  For example, if you multiple above matrices with 2 here are how the matrix multiplication will work  We call the number (\\\"2\\\" in this case) a scalar, so this is called \\\"scalar multiplication\\\", but that's not what you will learn here.

The `send_message_via_webhook` function expects only the `message_text` argument, but in the code, it is being called with two arguments (`webhook_url` and `message_text`).\n\n### Solution:\nTo fix the issue, you need to modify the call to `send_message_via_webhook` to only pass the `message_text` as an argument. Here's the corrected line of code:\n\n```python\nsend_message_via_webhook(message_text)\n```\n\nBy making this change, the `send_message_via_webhook` function will be called correctly with the expected single argument, resolving the issue in the code.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Webhooks | Docs | ChatBotKit\", \"url\": \"https://chatbotkit.com/docs/webhooks\", \"content\": \"Using the same secret key that you specified during webhook setup, compute the HMAC SHA-256 hash of the request body (you can extract the algorithm from the X-Hub-Signature header).

        "prompt": "# Question\nUsing IdentityServer4, how can we programmatically force a user to require setting a new password on login?\n\n# Answer\nTo programmatically force a user to set a new password on login using IdentityServer4, you can utilize the `RequirePasswordChange` property of the user's claims. Here are the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. When creating or updating a user's account, set the `RequirePasswordChange` claim to `true` to indicate that the user needs to set a new password on their next login.\n\n2. During the authentication process, after validating the user's credentials, you can check the `RequirePasswordChange` claim for the user.\n\n3. If the `RequirePasswordChange` claim is `true`, you can redirect the user to a password reset page where they can set a new password.\n\n4. After the user successfully sets a new password, update the `RequirePasswordChange` claim to `false` for that user.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this logic:\n\n```csharp\n// Step 1: Set the RequirePasswordChange claim for a user\nvar user = new User\n{\n    // Set other user properties\n    RequirePasswordChange = true\n};\n\n// Step 2: Check the RequirePasswordChange claim during authentication\nvar result = await _userManager.CheckPasswordAsync(user, password);\nif (result.Succeeded)\n{\n    if (user.RequirePasswordChange)\n    {\n        // Step 3: Redirect the user to the password reset page\n        return RedirectToAction(\"ResetPassword\", \"Account\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Proceed with normal login flow\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\n// Step 4: Update the RequirePasswordChange claim after password reset\nuser.RequirePasswordChange = false;\nawait _userManager.UpdateAsync(user);\n```\n\nRemember to adjust the code according to your specific implementation and user management setup.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Sign-in\\u00c2\\u00b6\", \"url\": \"https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/signin.html?highlight=UserInteraction\", \"content\": \"You can also optionally issue an idp claim (for the identity provider name), an amr claim (for the authentication method used), and/or an auth_time claim (for the epoch time a user authenticated).

        "prompt": "# Question\nexplain this The conceptual mappings of the dimensions of prejudice would in\u0002clude subuniverse of normative behavior and indices of social distance,\nantipathy, stereotyping, hypothetical interactions, and personal interac\u0002tions. In the attempt to point out prejudice in the American context,\nAmerican social scientists have long been able to use successfully in sur\u0002veys question items dealing with these various indices in order to study\nthe nature of prejudice in American society. This has been possible\nbecause questions of antipathy, social distance, and stereotyping are known\nto act as indices of items in the American universe of prejudice. They\ncorrelate so closely with prejudice that they may be viewed as \"equiva\u0002lents.\"\n\n# Answer\nIn the context of prejudice, the dimensions can be mapped conceptually to include:\n\n- **Subuniverse of Normative Behavior**: Reflects the norms and standards of behavior within a particular group or society.\n- **Indices of Social Distance**: Measure the level of perceived social separation or closeness between different groups.\n- **Antipathy**: Represents feelings of dislike, hostility, or aversion towards a particular group.\n- **Stereotyping**: Involves forming generalized beliefs or assumptions about individuals based on their group membership.\n- **Hypothetical Interactions**: Refers to imagined or potential interactions between individuals from different groups.\n- **Personal Interactions**: Actual encounters or experiences between individuals from diverse backgrounds.\n\nIn the American context, social scientists have effectively utilized survey questions related to these dimensions to identify and study prejudice in American society. Questions addressing antipathy, social distance, and stereotyping are particularly valuable as they are closely associated with prejudice and can serve as reliable indicators or \"equivalents\" of prejudiced attitudes in the American universe of prejudice.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Ideology and Prejudice: The Role of Value Conflicts\", \"url\": \"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2046999\", \"content\": \"\\tChambers, John R. and Schlenker, Barry and Collisson, Brian, Ideology and Prejudice: The Role of Value Conflicts (February 15, 2012).

There are limitations to the approach taken in this research. First, the predictive models were developed using one measure of explicit prejudice. Although this measure is a common one (Correll et al., 2010), it is not known if the precise model predictions would extend to other measures and, especially, if they would extend to measures of implicit prejudice. For example, it might be the case that status is more important for predicting the association between ideology and implicit prejudice. Answers to these questions will help further refine the models. Also, although the models were predictive in the sense that they accurately predicted the observations in future studies, the ideology-prejudice association is cross-sectional.

Discussion I tested whether I could use perceived group characteristics to predict the size and direction of the association between participants\\u2019 ideology and their prejudice against a variety of target groups.

Across three diverse samples in Study 1, conservatives had less favorable impressions than liberals of groups that were identified as liberal (e.g., African Americans, homosexuals), but more favorable impressions than liberals of groups identified as conservative (e.g., Christian fundamentalists, businesspeople). In Studies 2 and 3, we independently manipulated a target\\u2019s race (European American or African American) and political attitudes (liberal or conservative). Both studies found symmetrical preferences, with liberals and conservatives each liking attitudinally similar targets more than dissimilar targets. The amount of prejudice was comparable for liberals and conservatives, and the race of the target had no effect. In all three studies, the same patterns were obtained even after controlling for individual differences on prejudice-related dimensions (e.g., system justification, social-dominance orientation, modern racism).

Here is a breakdown of the calculation based on the input values:\n\n- Hours Worked: 50\n- Rate per Hour: $40\n- Category: The category is not explicitly mentioned in the query, but for this calculation, let's assume the category is 'S/ME'.\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n1. **Calculate Gross Pay:**\n   - Gross Pay = Hours Worked * Rate per Hour\n   - Gross Pay = 50 * $40 = $2000\n\n2. **Determine Tax Rate:**\n   - Since the category is 'S/ME', the tax rate is 0.20 (20%)\n\n3. **Calculate Tax Withheld:**\n   - Tax Withheld = Gross Pay * Tax Rate\n   - Tax Withheld = $2000 * 0.20 = $400\n\n4. **Calculate Take Home Pay:**\n   - Take Home Pay = Gross Pay - Tax Withheld\n   - Take Home Pay = $2000 - $400 = $1600\n\n### Expected Results:\n- Tax Withheld: $400\n- Take Home Pay: $1600\n\nTherefore, based on the input values provided (Hours Worked: 50, Rate per Hour: $40, Category: 'S/ME'), the expected tax withheld amount is $400, and the expected take-home pay is $1600.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Calculate your paycheck with paycheck calculators and withholding calculators\", \"url\": \"https://www.paycheckcity.com/calculator/\", \"content\": \"Salary and Hourly Calculators       Salary Calculator Determine your take-home pay or net pay for salaried employees.

This version ensures that the word \"by\" in titles does not affect the author assignment, and any title without an explicitly mentioned author gets \"Kaiser\" as its default author.\n\n```python\ndef process_lines(lines):\n    processed_lines = []\n    author = \"Kaiser\"  # Default author\n    for line in lines:\n        line = line.strip()\n        if not line:  # Skip empty lines\n            continue\n        if line.startswith(\"@\"):\n            # Extract author name, trimming the \"@\" symbols\n            author = line[1:-1]\n        else:\n            # Process book title\n            title = line\n            # Append the processed line with the current author\n            processed_lines.append(f\"'{title}', '{author}'\")\n\n    return \" $ \".join(processed_lines)\n\n# Example usage\nlines = [\n    \"@True@\",\n    \"Kai by the\",\n    \"Kiiiii\",\n    \"@Another Author@\",\n    \"tryiing\",\n    \"I don't by water\"\n]\n\nprocessed_text = process_lines(lines)\nprint(processed_text)\n```\n\nThis code snippet does the following:\n- It iterates through each line of input.\n- If a line starts with \"@\", it identifies the line as specifying an author and updates the current author.\n- If a line does not start with \"@\", it treats the line as a book title. The current author is either the last specified author or \"Kaiser\" if no author has been specified yet.\n- The word \"by\" in titles is treated as part of the title and does not affect author assignment.\n- The processed lines are joined into a single string, with each entry separated by \" $ \".\n\nThis approach ensures that the specific functionality you requested is implemented while keeping the code focused and straightforward.\n\n# Metadata\n[]\n\n# Your output",

In contrast, the luminance palette makes it much more clear that there are two prominent peaks. Varying luminance helps you see structure in data, and changes in luminance are more intuitively processed as changes in importance. But the plot on the right does not use a grayscale colormap. Its colorfulness makes it more interesting, and the subtle hue variation increases the perceptual distance between two values. As a result, small differences slightly easier to resolve. These examples show that color palette choices are about more than aesthetics: the colors you choose can reveal patterns in your data if used effectively or hide them if used poorly. There is not one optimal palette, but there are palettes that are better or worse for particular datasets and visualization approaches.

We usually program colors in a computer by specifying their RGB values, which set the intensity of the red, green, and blue channels in a display.

Here are a few things to consider:\n\n- Make sure that the value of `SelectedCom.Type` is exactly \"Person\" when you are expecting it to be so. Check the data being returned by the `_payeeService.GetListView()` method to ensure that the `Type` property of `SelectedCom` is indeed \"Person\".\n- Verify that the comparison is case-sensitive. If the comparison is case-sensitive, \"Person\" is not the same as \"person\" or \"PERSON\".\n- Double-check the logic flow and the values of variables like `selectedType`, `SelectedCom.Type`, and `payeeName.FullName` during runtime using debugging techniques. This will help you understand why the code is always going to the `else` block even when `selectedType` is \"Person\".\n\nIf you have already verified the above points and the issue persists, you may need to further investigate the values of the variables and the logic flow during runtime to pinpoint the exact reason why the code is always going to the `else` block.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"IObjectSpace.FirstOrDefault<ObjectType>(Expression<Func<ObjectType, Boolean>>) Method\", \"url\": \"https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.IObjectSpace.FirstOrDefault--1(System.Linq.Expressions.Expression-System.Func---0-System.Boolean--)\", \"content\": \" ParametrizedAction sendEmailAction = new ParametrizedAction(  this, \\\"SendEmail\\\", PredefinedCategory.Edit, typeof(string));  sendEmailAction.Execute += SendEmailAction_Execute;  private void SendEmailAction_Execute(object sender, ParametrizedActionExecuteEventArgs e) {  string contactParamValue = e.ParameterCurrentValue as string;  Contact contact = objectSpace.FirstOrDefault<Contact>(p => p.LastName == contactParamValue); Do not implement this method when you implement the IObjectSpace interface in a BaseObjectSpace descendant.

approach, the page uses the video's `@vercel/blob` URL to display the video using the `VideoComponent`. React Suspense is used to show a fallback until the video URL is fetched and the video is ready to be displayed.\\n\\n\\n### [Adding subtitles to your video](#adding-subtitles-to-your-video)\\n\\n\\nIf you have subtitles for your video, you can easily add them using the `<track>` element inside your `<video>` tag. You can fetch the subtitle file from Vercel Blob in a similar way as the video file. Here's how you can update the `<VideoComponent>` to include subtitles.\\n\\n\\napp/page.jsx\\n```\\nasync function VideoComponent({ fileName }) {\\n const {blobs} = await list({\\n prefix: fileName,\\n limit: 2\\n });\\n const { url } = blobs[0];\\n const { url: captionsUrl } = blobs[1];\\n \\n return (\\n <video controls preload=\\\"none\\\" aria-label=\\\"Video player\\\">\\n <source src={url} type=\\\"video/mp4\\\" />\\n <track\\n src={captionsUrl}\\n kind=\\\"subtitles\\\"\\n srclang=\\\"en\\\"\\n label=\\\"English\\\">\\n Your browser does not support the video tag.\\n </video>\\n );\\n};\\n```\\n\\nBy following this approach, you can effectively self-host and integrate videos into your Next.js applications.\\n\\n\\n[Resources](#resources)\\n-----------------------\\n\\n\\nTo continue learning more about video optimization and best practices, please refer to the following resources:\\n\\n\\n* **Understanding video formats and codecs**: Choose the right format and codec, like MP4 for compatibility or WebM for web optimization, for your video needs. For more details, see [Mozilla's guide on video codecs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Video_codecs).\\n* **Video compression**: Use tools like FFmpeg to effectively compress videos, balancing quality with file size. Learn about compression techniques at [FFmpeg's official website](https://www.ffmpeg.org/).\\n* **Resolution and bitrate adjustment**: Adjust [resolution and bitrate](https://www.dacast.com/blog/bitrate-vs-resolution/#:~:text=The%20two%20measure%20different%20aspects,yield%20different%20qualities%20of%20video) based on the viewing platform, with lower settings for mobile devices.\\n* **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Utilize a CDN to enhance video delivery speed and manage high traffic. When using some storage solutions, such as Vercel Blob, CDN functionality is automatically handled for you. [Learn more](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) about CDNs and their benefits.\\n\\n\\nExplore these video streaming

In this example, the three entities are \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cStudent,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cCourse,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d and \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cProfessor.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d 2. Identify the relationships: Relationships highlight how entities interact with each other. Relationships are typically verbs such as \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cbuys,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ccontains,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d or \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cdoes.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d In our example, the relationships \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cRegisters for\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d and \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cTeaches\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d effectively explain the interactions between the three entities.\"}]\n\n# Your output",

Relationship with conservation of energy and momentum[edit] In a one-dimensional collision, the two key principles are: conservation of energy (conservation of kinetic energy if the collision is perfectly elastic) and conservation of (linear) momentum. A third equation can be derived[ citation needed ] from these two, which is the restitution equation as stated above. When solving problems, any two of the three equations can be used. The advantage of using the restitution equation is that it sometimes provides a more convenient way to approach the problem.  Let , be the mass of object 1 and object 2 respectively.

The Full Map item is much like our Stone Tablet in this tutorial, though we could easily give the map the option to open up the game\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s world map so that it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s useful in-game. With our three map items ready we can make our conditional branches that check if we have the Ripped Map items. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll nest one inside the other, so that they\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll only be combined if both Ripped Maps are in the inventory. Our first conditional branch will check if the Ripped Map (Left Part) is in the inventory, and if it was then our next one will check for the Ripped Map (Right Part). If either of them aren\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t there, then a message about missing a piece will play. But when we do have both we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll set up a similar situation to before using Change Items to remove both Ripped Maps and give the Full Map item (along with a ME and message for our players). And with that, our players can piece together ripped map bits to form a map.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"GDevelop wiki\", \"url\": \"https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/tutorials/platformer/part-5\", \"content\": \"For the name of the layer, type \\u201cUI\\u201d.

It also includes logic to delete expired messages.\n\nTo organize this code effectively within your Django project, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Signal Handler File (`signals.py`):**\n   - Create a new Python file named `signals.py` within your Django app (where your models are located).\n   - Move the signal handling code (including the `@receiver` decorator and the `track_product_changes` function) to this file.\n\n2. **Model File (`models.py`):**\n   - Ensure that the `Product`, `Message`, and `UserProfile` models are defined in the `models.py` file of your Django app.\n   - Make sure to import the necessary modules in the `models.py` file, such as `from django.db import models`.\n\n3. **Management Command for Deleting Expired Messages:**\n   - Follow the previous instructions to create a management command file for deleting expired messages.\n   - You can place this management command file in the same directory as the `signals.py` file.\n\n4. **App Configuration:**\n   - Make sure to include the `signals.py` file in the `__init__.py` file of your app to ensure the signal handlers are registered when the app is loaded.\n\nBy organizing your code in this way, you separate the signal handling logic into its own file (`signals.py`) and keep the model definitions and other related code in the `models.py` file. Additionally, the management command for deleting expired messages can be placed in a separate file for better organization.\n\nRemember to run the management command periodically to delete expired messages as scheduled.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Django\", \"url\": \"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/signals/\", \"content\": \"For example, the  django.contrib.auth  app only prompts to create a  using  The database alias used for synchronization.

Second, assigning an image from to an item is a matter of bringing up the ListViewItem Collection Editor by pressing the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd button next to the Items property and setting the ImageIndex, as shown in Figure 3. Images can be set programmatically when items are adding by setting the image index property of the new item: Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) _\\u00a0 Handles MyBase.Load  \\u00a0 Dim item As ListViewItem = ListView1.Items.Add(\\\"Item6\\\")  When images are added from an image list, they show at runtime, as shown in Figure 4.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Add or Remove Images with ImageList Component - Windows Forms .NET Framework\", \"url\": \"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/controls/how-to-add-or-remove-images-with-the-windows-forms-imagelist-component?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8\", \"content\": \"However, you can add and remove images after associating the image list with a control.

Ensure that the `selectedType` variable is accessible in the scope where the code block is located.\n2. Update the code block to include a check for `selectedType` before executing the logic inside the `if (ActiveTabIndex == 0)` block.\n\nHere's how you can modify the code block to bind the value of `selectedType`:\n\n```csharp\nif (ActiveTabIndex == 0)\n{\n    responsiblityCenter = await _responsibilityService.GetResponView();\n    user = await _userService.All(\"\",\"\");\n    \n    if (voucherId > 0)\n    {\n        // Other existing logic\n        \n        // Add the following code to bind the value of selectedType\n        if (selectedType == \"Internal\")\n        {\n            user = await _userService.All(\"\", \"\");\n            selectedTypeVariable = selectedType;\n            selectedPayeeLabel = SelectedUser?.FullName;\n        }\n        else if (selectedType == \"Person\")\n        {\n            payeeName = payee.FirstOrDefault(a => a.PayeeId == PayeeId);\n            selectedTypeVariable = selectedType;\n            selectedPayeeLabel = payeeName?.FullName;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            SelectedCom = CompanyView.FirstOrDefault(a => a.PayeeId == PayeeId);\n            selectedTypeVariable = selectedType;\n            selectedPayeeLabel = SelectedCom?.CompanyName;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy adding this conditional logic within the `if (ActiveTabIndex == 0)` block, you can bind the value of `selectedType` to the appropriate variables based on the selected type (Person, Internal, or other).\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Azure OpenAI Service - Azure OpenAI\", \"url\": \"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/prompt-engineering\", \"content\": \"Instructions are likely the most commonly used prompt component.

        "prompt": "# Question\nthis two function is my problem\n\n# Answer\nBased on the provided code snippets, you have two functions, `SwitchTurns` and `Cards_Click`, that you're having issues with. The goal seems to be to switch turns between two players after a single card click or move. Let's address potential issues and solutions for each function:\n\n### `SwitchTurns` Function\n\nThe `SwitchTurns` function toggles the turn between two players and updates the UI to reflect whose turn it is. The function correctly toggles the `isPlayer1Turn` boolean variable and updates the UI elements (`label1` and `label2`) to visually indicate the active player. However, there was a mistake in the font size adjustment in your initial approach, which was corrected in the provided solution. Ensure you have the corrected version:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void SwitchTurns()\n{\n    isPlayer1Turn = !isPlayer1Turn;\n\n    if (isPlayer1Turn)\n    {\n        MessageBox.Show(\"Player 1's Turn\");\n        label1.ForeColor = Color.Black;\n        label2.ForeColor = Color.Red;\n        label1.Font = new Font(label1.Font.FontFamily, normalFontSize, FontStyle.Regular);\n        label2.Font = new Font(label2.Font.FontFamily, turnFontSize, FontStyle.Bold);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        label1.ForeColor = Color.Red;\n        label2.ForeColor = Color.Black;\n        label2.Font = new Font(label2.Font.FontFamily, normalFontSize, FontStyle.Regular);\n        label1.Font = new Font(label1.Font.FontFamily, turnFontSize, FontStyle.Bold);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### `Cards_Click` Function\n\nThe `Cards_Click` function is triggered when a card is clicked. It performs several operations, including setting the clicked card's image, removing the used image from a list, and adding the clicked card to a list of clicked cards. If a condition is met (in your case, checking if all 2-10 cards are clicked, which seems to be mistakenly set to check for just one card), it moves the clicked cards to a discard pile and then switches turns.\n\nTo ensure that turns switch after each card click or move, you should call `SwitchTurns` at the end of the `Cards_Click` function, outside any conditional checks that are not related to the turn switching itself. Here's a simplified example of how to incorporate the turn switch after a card is clicked:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void Cards_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    PictureBox pictureBox = sender as PictureBox;\n    if (pictureBox != null && images.Count > 0)\n    {\n        // Existing logic for handling a card click\n\n        // Always switch turns after handling the card click\n        SwitchTurns();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that regardless of other game logic, the turn will switch after a card is clicked.\n\n### Summary\n\n- Ensure the `SwitchTurns` function uses the corrected approach for font size adjustment.\n- Modify the `Cards_Click` function to call `SwitchTurns` at the end of the function to switch turns after every card click.\n\nThese adjustments should address the problem of switching turns between players after each move.\n\n# Metadata\n[]\n\n# Your output",

We create a new record on a form bound to a table on the one side of the relationship, and then click a button to open a new form bound to a table on the many side of the relationship.

Go to the Availability table, then create a new grid view that filters out any records that don't have an empty linked record field that links to the Schedule table.  You don't need much to create a working booking system in Airtable, so once you've finished the basics, you should feel free to add any details that suit your needs\\u2014like a phone number field or email field for the Schedule table, in which the client can type their contact information, for example. Next, go to the Schedule table and create a new form. The fields in this form builder will automatically populate based on all the fields in the Schedule table's grid view, so you'll see the field for the client name, the field for available time slots, as well as any other fields you might have added. You can customize the form's appearance to your liking, add help text, change the field names, make certain fields required, and adjust which fields will show in the final form. The last but most important step is to ensure that only available time slots can be selected from this form. Click into the linked record field for available time slots.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"How to make a simple booking system\", \"url\": \"https://blog.airtable.com/how-to-make-a-simple-booking-system/\", \"content\": \"Have you come up with some other ideas for how to use forms?

        "prompt": "# Question\nthat algorithm must also return splitted text, provide psuedocode for that\n\n# Answer\nTo modify the algorithm to not only check if the string can be split into a given number of words but also to return the actual split, we can use backtracking along with dynamic programming. Here is the pseudocode:\n\n```pseudocode\nfunction splitStringIntoWords(string, dictionary, num_words):\n    n = length(string)\n    initialize 2D array dp[n+1][num_words+1] with false values\n    initialize 2D array prevIndex[n+1][num_words+1] with -1 values\n    \n    dp[0][0] = true\n    \n    for i from 1 to n:\n        for k from 1 to num_words:\n            for j from 0 to i-1:\n                if dp[j][k-1] is true AND substring(string, j+1, i) is in dictionary:\n                    dp[i][k] = true\n                    prevIndex[i][k] = j\n                    break\n    \n    if dp[n][num_words] is false:\n        return \"Cannot split\"\n    \n    # Backtrack to find the split\n    words = []\n    currentLength = n\n    currentWordCount = num_words\n    \n    while currentWordCount > 0:\n        startIndex = prevIndex[currentLength][currentWordCount]\n        word = substring(string, startIndex+1, currentLength)\n        words.prepend(word) # Add word to the beginning of the list\n        currentLength = startIndex\n        currentWordCount -= 1\n    \n    return words\n\n# Helper function to get substring (1-indexed for pseudocode clarity)\nfunction substring(string, start, end):\n    return string[start:end]\n```\n\nThis pseudocode includes a `prevIndex` 2D array to remember the starting index of the substring that makes `dp[i][k]` true. After filling the `dp` and `prevIndex` arrays, it backtracks from `dp[n][num_words]` to find the actual words used in the split. The `words` list is built by prepending each found word, resulting in the correct order when the process completes.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"\", \"url\": \"http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/fall01/cps130/lectures/lect21.pdf\", \"content\": \"Want to go from beginning of sentence to the end using only valid words.

It provides options to insert a node at the end, delete a node from the end, and display the list.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the program:\n\n- The program starts with a struct definition for a node in the linked list. Each node contains an integer data value and a pointer to the next node.\n- The program declares a global variable `head` of type `struct node*` to keep track of the head of the linked list. It is initially set to NULL.\n- The program defines four functions: `lastinsert()`, `lastdelete()`, `display()`, and `main()`.\n- `lastinsert()` function is used to insert a new node at the end of the linked list. It takes user input for the data value, creates a new node dynamically using `malloc()`, and inserts it at the end of the list. If the list is empty, the new node becomes the head. Otherwise, it traverses the list to find the last node and updates its `next` pointer to the new node.\n- `lastdelete()` function is used to delete the last node from the linked list. It checks if the list is empty and if the head is the only node. If so, it sets the head to NULL and frees the memory. Otherwise, it traverses the list to find the second last node and updates its `next` pointer to NULL. Finally, it frees the memory of the last node.\n- `display()` function is used to display the elements of the linked list. It traverses the list starting from the head and prints the data value of each node until it reaches the head again.\n- `main()` function is the entry point of the program. It displays a menu of options and uses a switch statement to call the corresponding functions based on the user's choice. It runs in an infinite loop until the user chooses to exit.\n\nLet me know if you have any specific questions about the code.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"C++ Programming Code Examples\", \"url\": \"https://cplusplus.happycodings.com/data-structures/cplusplus-program-to-use-linked-list-and-subtract-two-large-numbers.html\", \"content\": \"Inside the curly braces, we can declare the member variables of different types.

This is typically done after all training epochs are completed.\n\n```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0\n# Save the trained model\ntorch.save(model.state_dict(), 'savedmodel.pt')\n```\n\n\n\n### Creating the Sampling Script\nFor the sampling script (`scripts/sampling.py`), you'll need to handle command-line arguments for the source image, target image, and the output path for the harmonized image. You'll load the trained model, perform the harmonization, and save the result.\n\n1. **Parse Command Line Arguments**:\n   Use `argparse` to handle command line arguments for the source image, target image, and the output path.\n\n```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0\nimport argparse\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n    parser.add_argument('--source_image', type=str, help='Path to the source image')\n    parser.add_argument('--target_image', type=str, help='Path to the target image')\n    parser.add_argument('--output_path', type=str, help='Path to save the harmonized image')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n```\n\n\n\n2. **Load the Trained Model**:\n   Initialize the model and load its weights from the saved file.\n\n```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0\n# Assuming the model definition is available in the script or imported correctly\nmodel = Unet(dim=64, dim_mults=(1, 2, 4, 8), channels=1)\nmodel.load_state_dict(torch.load('savedmodel.pt'))\nmodel.eval()  # Set the model to evaluation mode\n```\n\n\n\n3. **Image Harmonization**:\n   You will need to implement a function or process within your script to perform image harmonization using your model. This involves loading the source and target images, processing them as required by your model, and then using the model to generate the harmonized image.\n\n4. **Saving the Harmonized Image**:\n   After generating the harmonized image, save it using an appropriate library, such as `PIL` or `OpenCV`.\n\n```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming harmonized_image is a numpy array or a PyTorch tensor in the correct format\nImage.fromarray(harmonized_image.astype(np.uint8)).save(args.output_path)\n```\n\n\nEnsure your script includes the necessary imports and properly integrates these components. Depending on your specific model and data, additional preprocessing or postprocessing steps may be required.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"CODE\", \"code\": \"\\n        dl =

        "prompt": "# Question\nWrite a cheat sheet for the App Router\n\n# Answer\n### App Router Cheat Sheet\n\n#### Routing\n- Define routes using the App Router by specifying the route paths and corresponding components.\n- Create dynamic routes by using square brackets in the route path.\n- Use route groups to organize related routes together.\n\n#### Data Fetching\n- Fetch, cache, and revalidate data using the App Router.\n- Perform server actions and mutations to interact with data on the server.\n\n#### Rendering\n- Utilize server components for server-side rendering.\n- Use client components for client-side rendering.\n- Implement composition patterns to structure your components effectively.\n\n#### Caching\n- Cache data to improve performance and reduce unnecessary data fetching.\n\n#### Styling\n- Use CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, CSS-in-JS, or Sass for styling your components.\n\n#### Optimizing\n- Optimize images, videos, fonts, metadata, and scripts for better performance.\n- Analyze your bundle size using the Bundle Analyzer.\n- Implement lazy loading for improved loading times.\n- Utilize analytics and instrumentation for monitoring and improving performance.\n\n#### Configuring\n- Configure TypeScript, ESLint, environment variables, absolute imports, MDX, src directory, draft mode, and content security policy.\n\n#### Testing\n- Use Vitest, Jest, Playwright, or Cypress for testing your application.\n\n#### Authentication\n- Implement authentication in your application.\n\n#### Deploying\n- Follow the production checklist for deploying your application.\n- Use static exports for static site generation.\n\n#### Upgrading\n- Use codemods for upgrading your application.\n- Migrate from Vite or Create React App if needed.\n\n#### API Reference\n- Reference various components and file conventions available in the App Router.\n\n### For more detailed information, refer to the [App Router Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing).\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"WEB_PAGE\", \"title\": \"Optimizing: Videos | Next.js\", \"urls\":

        "prompt": "# Question\ntell me about nginx conf dile\n\n# Answer\nThe Nginx configuration file, usually named \"nginx.conf\", is the main configuration file for the Nginx web server. It contains directives that define how Nginx should handle incoming requests, manage server resources, and configure various aspects of the server.\n\nHere is an overview of the main sections and directives commonly found in the Nginx configuration file:\n\n1. Events: This section defines how Nginx handles connections and events. It includes directives such as \"worker_connections\" to set the maximum number of simultaneous connections and \"use\" to specify the event-driven model (e.g., \"epoll\", \"kqueue\", \"eventport\").\n\n2. HTTP: This section is used to configure the HTTP server and its behavior. It includes directives such as \"server\" to define server blocks, \"location\" to specify how to handle requests for specific URLs, and \"include\" to include additional configuration files.\n\n3. Server: Within the HTTP section, the server block is used to define the server's behavior for a specific IP address and port. It includes directives such as \"listen\" to specify the IP address and port to listen on, \"server_name\" to define the server's domain name, and \"root\" to set the document root directory.\n\n4. Location: Within the server block, the location block is used to define how Nginx handles requests for specific URLs. It includes directives such as \"proxy_pass\" to forward requests to a backend server, \"try_files\" to specify the order of file lookups, and \"rewrite\" to modify the URL.\n\n5. Upstream: This section is used to define groups of backend servers that Nginx can load balance requests to. It includes directives such as \"server\" to specify the backend server's IP address and port, and \"weight\" to assign a weight to each server for load balancing.\n\n6. Includes: The Nginx configuration file can include additional configuration files using the \"include\" directive. This allows for modular and organized configuration management.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific configuration directives and their usage may vary depending on the version of Nginx and any additional modules that are installed.\n\nIf you have a specific question or need help with a particular aspect of the Nginx configuration file, please let me know and I'll be happy to assist you further.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"How To Configure The Nginx Web Server On a Virtual Private Server | DigitalOcean\", \"url\": \"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-the-nginx-web-server-on-a-virtual-private-server\", \"content\": \"These directories are used to define configurations for your websites.

        "prompt": "# Question\nGreat. Write a complete code on real time monitoring of rural drinking water supply \n\n# Answer\nCreating a complete code for real-time monitoring of rural drinking water supply involves several components, including hardware for data collection (sensors), a database for storing data, and software for data analysis and visualization. Given the complexity and the broad scope of such a project, I'll outline a basic framework using Python for the software part, which assumes you have sensors in place for collecting data like water flow, quality (pH, turbidity, etc.), and level.\n\n### Components Overview:\n\n1. **Hardware (Sensors):** Devices to measure water quality, level, and flow rate. These devices should be capable of sending data to a central server or directly accessible via the internet (IoT devices).\n\n2. **Database:** A system to store the collected data. For simplicity, we'll use SQLite in this example, but a more scalable solution might require a more robust database system.\n\n3. **Software:**\n   - **Data Collection:** A script to receive data from sensors and store it in the database.\n   - **Data Analysis:** Basic analysis on the collected data.\n   - **Visualization:** A simple web application to display real-time data.\n\n### Step 1: Database Setup\n\nFirst, set up a SQLite database to store the sensor data.\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\ndef create_database():\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('water_supply.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS water_quality\n                 (timestamp TEXT, sensor_id TEXT, pH REAL, turbidity REAL, flow_rate REAL, water_level REAL)''')\n    conn.commit()\n    conn.close()\n\ncreate_database()\n```\n\n### Step 2: Data Collection\n\nAssuming your sensors can send HTTP requests, you can set up a Flask application to receive data.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request\nimport sqlite3\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/submit_data', methods=['POST'])\ndef submit_data():\n    data = request.json\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('water_supply.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    c.execute(\"INSERT INTO water_quality (timestamp, sensor_id, pH, turbidity, flow_rate, water_level) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\",\n              (data['timestamp'], data['sensor_id'], data['pH'], data['turbidity'], data['flow_rate'], data['water_level']))\n    conn.commit()\n    conn.close()\n    return \"Data received\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Data Analysis and Visualization\n\nFor real-time monitoring and visualization, you can use Dash by Plotly, a Python framework for building web applications.\n\n```python\nimport dash\nfrom dash import html, dcc\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sqlite3\n\napp = dash.Dash(__name__)\n\ndef get_data():\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('water_supply.db')\n    df = pd.read_sql_query(\"SELECT * FROM water_quality ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 100\", conn)\n    conn.close()\n    return df\n\napp.layout = html.Div(children=[\n    html.H1(children='Real-Time Monitoring of Rural Drinking Water Supply'),\n    dcc.Interval(\n            id='interval-component',\n            interval=1*1000, # in milliseconds\n            n_intervals=0\n    ),\n    dcc.Graph(id='live-update-graph'),\n])\n\n@app.callback(dash.dependencies.Output('live-update-graph', 'figure'),\n              [dash.dependencies.Input('interval-component', 'n_intervals')])\ndef update_graph_live(n):\n    df = get_data()\n    figure = px.line(df, x='timestamp', y='pH', title='Water pH Over Time')\n    return figure\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run_server(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Note:\n\n- This example assumes you have a basic understanding of Python, Flask, and Dash.\n- The Flask app for data collection and the Dash app for visualization could run on the same server but are shown separately for clarity.\n- You'll need to replace sensor data collection and submission logic according to your actual hardware setup.\n- This example uses SQLite for simplicity. For a production system, consider using a more scalable database system.\n- Ensure your sensor hardware is capable of sending data in the format expected by the Flask app.\n- Install necessary libraries using `pip install flask dash pandas plotly sqlite3`.\n\nThis framework provides a starting point. Depending on the project's scale and requirements, you might need to consider more robust solutions for each component, especially for handling larger volumes of data and ensuring the reliability of the sensor network.\n\n# Metadata\n[]\n\n# Your output",

It iterates through the list of strings and checks if the length of each string is not zero. If the length is greater than the given index, it checks if the character at that index matches the given letter. If it does, it returns a message indicating that the string has the letter at the index. If it does not, it returns a message indicating that the string does not have the letter at the index. If the length of the string is less than the given index, it returns a message indicating that the index is larger than the length of the string. If the length of the string is zero, it returns a message indicating that the length of the string is equal to zero.\n\nThe code then prompts the user to enter the number of strings and the strings themselves, and stores them in a list called `list1`. It also prompts the user to enter a letter and checks if its length is equal to 1. If it is, it prompts the user to enter an index and calls the `function` with the `list1`, index, and letter as arguments. The result is then printed.

Threaded binary trees are a form of binary tree where in addition to the child nodes, pointers are added to the in-order predecessor and successor nodes. These are known as threads. This structure allows for efficient traversal operations without the need for recursion or a stack.\n\n### Issues in the `delete` Method\n\n1. **Handling Nodes with Two Children**: The method correctly identifies nodes with two children and attempts to replace the node to be deleted with its in-order successor. However, it's crucial to ensure that the threads (left and right) of the successor node are correctly updated after the deletion, especially if the successor has a right child. This is a common area where errors might occur, leading to instability.\n\n2. **Thread Updates**: After deletion, the method updates the dummy node's left and right pointers to point to the tree's leftmost and rightmost nodes, respectively. Ensure that these updates correctly reflect the tree's new structure post-deletion.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that edge cases, such as deleting the root node in a tree with only one node or deleting nodes close to the dummy node, are handled correctly to maintain the tree's integrity.\n\n### Issues in the `insert` Method\n\n1. **Thread Management**: When inserting a new node, it's critical to correctly manage the threads. The new node's left and right pointers must be updated to point to its in-order predecessor and successor, respectively. Similarly, the predecessor's and successor's threads must be updated to point back to the new node if necessary.\n\n2. **Root and Dummy Node Handling**: The insertion method starts by checking if the root is null and correctly initializes the root and dummy nodes if so. Ensure that when a new root node is inserted, its threads are correctly initialized to point to the dummy node, and vice versa.\n\n3. **Duplicate Data Handling**: The method returns without insertion if the data already exists in the tree. Ensure that this check is correctly implemented to prevent instability caused by attempting to insert duplicate values.\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n- **Thorough Testing**: Test the `delete` and `insert` methods with a variety of cases, including inserting and deleting nodes with zero, one, and two children, as well as edge cases like the root node or nodes adjacent to the dummy node.\n- **Print Statements**: Temporarily add print statements to track the execution flow and verify that threads are correctly updated at each step.\n- **Visual Debugging**: If possible, use a debugger that can visualize the tree structure, or manually draw the tree before and after operations to ensure that the structure and threads are as expected.\n\nGiven the complexity of threaded binary trees, careful attention to detail is required when modifying threads during insertions and deletions to maintain the tree's integrity and traversal efficiency.\n\n# Metadata\n[]\n\n# Your output",

Here is an example of how you can add subtitles to a video in a Next.js application:\n\n```jsx\n// Import the necessary functions and components\nimport { list } from '@vercel/blob';\n\n// Define the VideoComponent function\nasync function VideoComponent({ fileName }) {\n    // Fetch the video and subtitles URLs from Vercel Blob\n    const { blobs } = await list({\n        prefix: fileName,\n        limit: 2\n    });\n    const { url } = blobs[0];\n    const { url: captionsUrl } = blobs[1];\n\n    // Return the video element with subtitles\n    return (\n        <video controls preload=\"none\" aria-label=\"Video player\">\n            <source src={url} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n            <track\n                src={captionsUrl}\n                kind=\"subtitles\"\n                srclang=\"en\"\n                label=\"English\"\n            />\n            Your browser does not support the video tag.\n        </video>\n    );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The `VideoComponent` function fetches the video and subtitles URLs from Vercel Blob using the `list` function.\n- The `<video>` element is rendered with the video source and a `<track>` element for subtitles.\n- The subtitles are specified with the `kind=\"subtitles\"`, `srclang=\"en\"` (language), and `label=\"English\"` attributes.\n\nYou can use this approach to effectively add subtitles to videos in your Next.js application.\n\n# Metadata\nN/A\n\n# Your output",

Monty and Tony wish to connect with viewers through their world of imagination, inspiring the audience to feel empowered and engaged with the world they have created. Born and raised in the Bronx, Kaleidoskull Co-Founder Tony Philippou draws upon his own mixed cultural Puerto-Rican/Greek heritage, growing up during the burgeoning hip-hop era of the 1980s. Immersed in a culturally rich environment in his formative years, while experiencing and being surrounded by extreme poverty, enhanced his life in every aspect. As a father, he has made a conscious effort to create images of heroic women that his daughter can relate to and feel empowered by.

One of the primary challenges for the Mapping team at Lyft is to translate the noisy GPS signal from our driver and rider devices into accurate location tracking on the map. This helps power rider and driver matching, dispatch decisions, accurate ETA predictions, and much more! We call this process map matching.</p><figure><figcaption>Figure 1: example of noisy location data in a dense urban area and improvements after map matching</figcaption></figure><p>Map data helps the map matching process because it can reduce the space of locations to just the roads. For this reason, historically, we ran our map matching algorithms on the server-side to utilize the underlying map data.</p><p>For the past year, we have been building out an on-device localization system.

These services are characterized by frequent background traffic without user operations that affects the energy consumption of the mobile terminal and cellular network load. These factors are related to the RRC (radio resource control) state. If a server takes the RRC state of the mobile terminals into account and controls the timings for sending messages, the energy consumption and cellular network load can be reduced. In this paper, we propose methods for estimating the RRC state in push servers for controlling messaging timings.

And once a particular file passes a threshold (such as 75%), the remaining non-styled sections can be updated. It is also important to note that modern IDEs allow for the configuration of formatting rules; take advantage of this assistance where available. Principles of Modern Java Style The most important aspect of style is simplicity, since the simpler the style the easier it is to remember and apply. No\\u00a0developer wants to memorize hundreds of rules and dozens of exception in order to write software. There is an overall guiding principle that is commonly known as \\\"The Boy Scout Rule for Software Development\\\". This simply states that a developer should leave the code in a better state than when they found it, much like Boy Scouts and their creed to maintain camp sites. Highlights of Coding and Formatting Conventions Code Formatting Formatting consists of all the typological conventions that give code its basic appearance and includes indentation, the use of comments, and where braces appear. Some best practices: Nest code and use four spaces for indentation. This gives a good\\u00a0trade-off between emphasizing the text indentation at each level and does not push text too far into the line if multiple indentations levels are required.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"The Elements of Modern Java Style - DZone\", \"url\": \"https://dzone.com/articles/the-elements-of-modern-java-style\", \"content\": \"It is very rare that there is an exception that will truly never occur and can be ignored.  try }  Catch exceptions in as small an exception scope as possible. Do not wrap a try block around a section of code and then only catch java.lang.Throwable. Some exception cases are easier to recover from than others; it is best not to lump non-recoverable errors (such as java.lang.OutOfMemoryError) with more reasonable expected exceptions (such as java.lang.NumberFormatException when converting a String into an Integer). Synchronization Synchronization is the enforcement that only a single thread\\u00a0shall have access to a particular portion of code or an object at one moment. The most important rule of maintaining data integrity in a threaded environment is to always allocate and synchronize on an object that is used exclusively for synchronization purposes. Java does provide a mechanism to apply synchronization to classes or methods, but this implicitly or explicitly uses the instance of the class object itself as the synchronization object. That means that all synchronized methods in the class will be blocked if a thread is locked in one of them. As such, to prevent unintended consequences, always use an Object other than the current object (this) as the synchronization lock token. private String fileLock = \\u201ctoken\\u201d;\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"The Elements of Modern Java Style - DZone\", \"url\": \"https://dzone.com/articles/the-elements-of-modern-java-style\", \"content\": \"   This article is featured in the new DZone Guide to Modern Java, Volume II. Get your free copy for more insightful articles, industry statistics, and more. Code Style and How to Use It Compilers and interpreters require the syntax of code to conform to a given programming language\\u2019s grammar. Humans, however, require additional guides to translate the cold instructions of machine code into something that can be followed and understood. Code style can provide these cues, and can include things like basic text formatting, indentation, and small methods. Style can also apply to the use of design patterns, such as best practices for things like constructor chaining, exception handling, and synchronization. Well-styled code is easy to read, like well-written prose. And easier-to-read code means it is easier to understand, and this means more robust, error-free software that developers are happy to work with. Coding style also works best when it is consistent throughout the whole codebase.

Meaningful Variable and Method Names  Meaningful Variable and Method Names refer to the practice of giving descriptive, clear, and indicative names to variables and methods in your Java code. The goal is to choose names that convey the purpose, functionality, or content of the variable or method without needing extensive comments or further explanation. In essence, when you or another developer read the code, the names of variables and methods should provide valuable information about what they represent or do, making the code self-explanatory and easier to understand. Here are some key principles behind meaningful variable and method names:   Clarity: The names should be clear and unambiguous, leaving no room for misinterpretation. A developer should be able to quickly understand what a variable represents or what a method does just by looking at its name. Descriptiveness: Names should accurately describe the purpose or content of the element they represent. Choose names that reflect the nature of the data or the operation being performed. Consistency: Use consistent naming conventions throughout your codebase. This includes adhering to naming conventions specific to Java, such as camelCase for variable and method names, and adhering to any naming conventions established within your project or organization.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Mastering Clean Code in Java: Best Practices and Tips - Java Code Geeks\", \"url\": \"https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2023/09/mastering-clean-code-in-java-best-practices-and-tips.html\", \"content\": \"Replacing it with a named constant or an enumeration makes the code more understandable: final String ADMIN_ROLE = \\\"admin\\\";   Why Avoid Magic Numbers and Strings:    Readability: Named constants provide meaningful context, making it clear what the values represent. This improves the readability of your code, making it easier for developers to understand. Maintainability: When you need to update a value, such as the number of days in a week or a specific role, you only need to change it in one place (the constant definition). This reduces the risk of introducing bugs due to inconsistent values. Self-Documenting: Named constants act as self-documentation for your code. Developers can understand the purpose and significance of the value without the need for comments or external documentation. Preventing Bugs: Magic numbers and strings can lead to errors when values are changed inconsistently or misunderstood by developers. Using named constants helps prevent such bugs. Consistency: When multiple parts of your codebase use the same value, naming it as a constant ensures consistency in the usage of that value.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Mastering Clean Code in Java: Best Practices and Tips - Java Code Geeks\", \"url\": \"https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2023/09/mastering-clean-code-in-java-best-practices-and-tips.html\", \"content\": \"// Code review comment: Suggesting a variable name change  2.1.10 Unit Testing  Unit Testing is a software testing technique in which individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation from the rest of the application. A unit, in this context, refers to the smallest testable part of a software system, often an individual function or method. The primary purpose of unit testing is to validate that each unit of code functions correctly and produces the expected outcomes when provided with specific inputs. Here are the key characteristics and principles of unit testing:   Isolation: Unit tests are designed to be isolated from the broader application. This means that a unit test should focus exclusively on the behavior of a single function or method, disregarding the interactions with other parts of the system. Repeatable: Unit tests must be repeatable, meaning that they produce consistent results when executed multiple times with the same inputs. This predictability is essential for detecting and diagnosing issues. Automated: Unit tests are typically automated, meaning they can be executed automatically by a testing framework or tool. Automation allows for frequent and efficient testing as the code evolves.\"}]\n\n# Your output",

Dominos charges a flat rate for each additional topping regardless of what the topping is. On a standard XL Robust Inspired Tomato Sauce Pizza the first topping costs $5.74.

        "prompt": "# Question\nwhat is the repository about?\n\n# Answer\nThe repository contains an example modeling a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) Drive using Field-Oriented Control (FOC), along with supporting design scripts. It demonstrates various aspects of modeling, analyzing, and optimizing an electric drive system. The main highlights include:\n\n1. Determining open-loop frequency response and checking stability margins, which requires Simulink\u00ae Control Design using the Frequency Response Estimator block.\n2. Determining the optimum d-axis and q-axis currents to minimize overall motor losses when delivering a commanded torque and speed.\n3. Implementation of an Electric Drive using a detailed nonlinear motor model in the form of tabulated flux linkages and Steinmetz coefficients.\n4. Optimization of a Field-Oriented Controller (FOC) to minimize motor losses.\n\nThis is detailed in the HTML documentation titled \"PMSM Drive Using Field-Oriented Control,\" which provides insights into system modeling, the model itself, the inverter model, the field-oriented controller, plotting losses with the original controller, and optimizing the controller to minimize losses.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"CODE\", \"code\": \"Copyright (c) 2022, The MathWorks, Inc.\\nAll rights reserved.\\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\\n1.

All of this makes coco a comfortable and familiar media to work with. If you are just getting started, be sure to read our article, \\u201cHow to Grow Cannabis Seedlings in Coco Coir\\u201d The main difference between growing in coco and growing in soil is the fertigation strategy. Growing in soil requires lower frequency fertigation because of the air to water ratio. However, in coco, we can ramp up the frequency and get truly explosive growth. Plants grown in coco under high frequency fertigation will grow as fast or faster than plants grown in any other medium. A well-managed coco grow cannot be beat. Delivering fertilizers through the irrigation water is the most efficient form of fertilization. It allows growers to supply plants with the exact nutrients that they require in forms that are easily accessible.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Growing Cannabis in Coco Coir with High Frequency Fertigation - Coco For Cannabis\", \"url\": \"https://www.cocoforcannabis.com/principles-fertigation-feed-water-cannabis-coco/\", \"content\": \"These are large enough to allow you to maintain an acceptable EC and NER balance with only once or twice daily fertigation.

Be sure to read our article \\u201cTransplanting Cannabis Plants: Why, When, and How\\u201d. Effective fertigation is the key to maximizing the speed of growth and the size of harvests. Understanding the five key principles of high frequency fertigation will allow you to manage your coco grow like a pro! A tremendous amount of confusion exists in the cannabis growing community about how plants interact with water and nutrition. It is important to understand that although you mix the nutrients with the water, the plant takes them up separately. Water is pulled across root membranes through osmosis and nutrients enter the plant separately, through diffusion, passive transport, and active transport. The plant receives water and nutrients through different processes, and they must be balanced.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Growing Cannabis in Coco Coir with High Frequency Fertigation - Coco For Cannabis\", \"url\": \"https://www.cocoforcannabis.com/principles-fertigation-feed-water-cannabis-coco/\", \"content\": \"Plant roots require both oxygen and water. If the roots are starved of oxygen, they will turn brown and die. Soil based growing media become oxygen depleted when they are saturated with water. This means that the roots are unable to get enough air for some time after each watering. Growers need to wait for soil to dry out before watering again because otherwise the roots will not get enough oxygen and they will die. One of the miraculous things about coco coir, especially when its mixed with perlite, is that it is nearly impossible to over-water it. Unlike soil, coco maintains sufficient oxygen in the root zone even when it is at field capacity (completely saturated with water). This is due to the physical shape and characteristics of the coco fibers which retain air even when the media is saturated with water. As a result, we can keep the coco wet and not worry that we are drowning the plant roots. Indeed, in coco, when the media is wet, the air to water ratio is ideal.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Manual do coc\\u00f4 saud\\u00e1vel: fique de olho nas formas e cores das suas fezes\", \"url\": \"https://www.correio24horas.com.br/noticia/nid/manual-do-coco-saudavel-fique-de-olho-nas-formas-e-cores-das-suas-fezes/\", \"content\": \"Melhor rever seus h\\u00e1bitos.\\u00a0  L\\u00edquido: \\u00a0Comum no piriri.

Here is a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. The script imports the necessary libraries `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for making HTTP requests and parsing HTML content, respectively.\n   \n2. It sets the values for `bot_token` and `chat_id` which are used for Telegram bot authentication and chat identification.\n\n3. There is a function `send_notification(message)` that sends a message to a Telegram chat using the Telegram bot API.\n\n4. Another function `check_for_new_matches()` is defined to scrape a website (https://24score.pro/football/top_streaks/under/) for new football matches.\n\n5. The script sends an HTTP GET request to the website with a custom user-agent header to mimic a web browser.\n\n6. If the response status code is 200 (indicating a successful request), it parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup to find all the match information.\n\n7. It then iterates over each match, checks if it has not been published yet, and if so, it calls the `send_notification()` function with a message \"\u0417\u043d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0447!\" (Found a new match!).\n\n8. If the request fails (status code is not 200), it prints \"\u041d\u0435 \u0432\u0434\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u043d\u043a\u0443.\" (Failed to get the page).\n\n9. Finally, the script calls the `check_for_new_matches()` function to initiate the process of checking for new matches.\n\nOverall, the script is designed to notify about new football matches found on a specific website using Telegram.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"GitHub - Mark-Ryan/Football-Weather-Emailer-0.1: Emails the Florida Youth Football Match Times and Weather Forecasts Alerts Using Python 3.5.2\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/Mark-Ryan/Football-Weather-Emailer-0.1\", \"content\": \"  If you are running Mac OSX I would reccomend you install Python 3.5.2 through homebrew.

An ethical hedonist will do anything within his capacity to maximize the pleasures of life. Considering pleasure as the only intrinsically valuable aspect of life and living a life based on such terms does sound appealing. There are arguments against the philosophy deeming it superficial. However, there are variants of the school of thought that makes it more complex. For example, Epicurean Hedonism is the philosophical quest to reduce the anguish caused by life and the fear of death. The Paradox of Hedonism, however, lies in the argument that constant pursuing of pleasure hinders the process of actually experiencing it. Nihilists believe that there is no value, motive or purpose to live and that the sense of morality or the judgement of right from wrong are based on man-made, arbitrary standards.

Below is a basic example of HTML and CSS code to get you started:\n\n**HTML:**\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Language Translator</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"translator-container\">\n        <h1>Language Translator</h1>\n        <select id=\"source-language\">\n            <option value=\"en\">English</option>\n            <option value=\"fr\">French</option>\n            <!-- Add more language options here -->\n        </select>\n        <textarea id=\"input-text\" placeholder=\"Enter text to translate...\"></textarea>\n        <button id=\"translate-btn\">Translate</button>\n        <select id=\"target-language\">\n            <option value=\"en\">English</option>\n            <option value=\"fr\">French</option>\n            <!-- Add more language options here -->\n        </select>\n        <textarea id=\"output-text\" placeholder=\"Translated text will appear here...\" readonly></textarea>\n    </div>\n    <script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**CSS:**\n```css\nbody {\n    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: center;\n    align-items: center;\n    height: 100vh;\n    background-color: #f0f0f0;\n}\n\n.translator-container {\n    max-width: 400px;\n    padding: 20px;\n    background-color: #fff;\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n}\n\nh1 {\n    text-align: center;\n}\n\nselect, textarea, button {\n    width: 100%;\n    margin-bottom: 10px;\n    padding: 8px;\n    font-size: 16px;\n    border: 1px solid #ccc;\n    border-radius: 4px;\n}\n\nbutton {\n    background-color: #007bff;\n    color: #fff;\n    cursor: pointer;\n}\n\ntextarea {\n    resize: vertical;\n}\n```\n\nThis code provides a basic structure for a language translator web app using HTML for the layout and CSS for styling.

        "prompt": "# Question\nHow cross-validation works:\n\n# Answer\n- Cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model.\n- It involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets (folds) for training and testing the model.\n- One common method is k-fold cross-validation, where the data is divided into k subsets, and the model is trained and tested k times.\n- In each iteration, one of the k subsets is used as the test set, and the remaining k-1 subsets are used for training.\n- The performance of the model is evaluated by averaging the results from all k iterations.\n- Cross-validation helps in assessing how well a model will generalize to new, unseen data.\n- It is important for reducing the risk of overfitting or underfitting a model.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Cross-Validation\", \"url\": \"https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/cross-validation.html\", \"content\": \"  Leaveout: Partitions data using the k-fold approach where k is equal to the total number of observations in the data and all data will be used once as a test set. Also known as leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV).   Repeated random sub-sampling: Creates multiple random partitions of data to use as training set and testing set using the Monte Carlo methodology and aggregates results over all the runs. This technique has a similar idea as the k-fold but each test set is chosen independently, which means some data points might be used for testing more than once.   Stratify: Partitions data such that both training and test sets have roughly the same class proportions in the response or target.   Resubstitution: Does not partition the data and all data is used for training the model. The error is evaluated by comparing the outcome against actual values. This approach often produces overly optimistic estimates for performance and should be avoided if there is sufficient data. Cross-validation can be a computationally intensive operation since training and validation is done several times. However, it is a critical step in model development to reduce the risk of overfitting or underfitting a model.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Cross-Validation\", \"url\": \"https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/cross-validation.html\", \"content\": \"However, dividing the dataset to maximize both learning and validity of test results is difficult. This is where cross-validation comes into practice. Cross-validation offers several techniques that split the data differently, to find the best algorithm for the model. Cross-validation also helps with choosing the best performing model by calculating the error using the testing dataset, which has not been used to train. The testing dataset helps calculate the accuracy of the model and how it will generalize with future data.   k-fold: Partitions data into k randomly chosen subsets (or folds) of roughly equal size. One subset is used to validate the model trained using the remaining subsets. This process is repeated k times such that each subset is used exactly once for validation. The average error across all k partitions is reported as \\u03b5. This is one of the most popular techniques for cross-validation but can take a long time to execute because the model needs to be trained repeatedly.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Cross Validation: A Beginner\\u2019s Guide\", \"url\": \"https://towardsdatascience.com/cross-validation-a-beginners-guide-5b8ca04962cd?gi=27dfbb235e5d\", \"content\": \"This is because that method creates and evaluates a model for each row in the dataset, in this case over 20,000.

Hold out method  The hold out method can be effective and computationally inexpensive on very large datasets, or on limited computational resources. It is also often easier to implement and understand for beginners. However, it is very rarely good to apply to small datasets as it can significantly reduce the training data available and hurt model performance. K-Fold Cross Validation  K-Fold can be very effective on medium sized datasets, though by adjusting the K value can significantly alter the results of the validation. Let\\u2019s add to our rule from earlier; as k increases, bias decreases, and variance and computational requirements increase.

On overfit model is generated when the model is so tightly fit to the training data that it may account for random noise or unwanted trends which will not be present or useful in predicting targets for subsequent datasets. Underfit occurs when the model is not complex enough to account for general trends in the data which would be useful in predicting targets in subsequent datasets, such as using a linear fit on a polynomial trend(An awesome visualization and further explanation of this concept from AWS can be found here). Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html   When creating a model, we account for a few types of error: validation error, testing error, error due to bias, and error due to variance in a relationship known as the bias variance trade-off (another great visual here). Source: http://www.luigifreda.com/2017/03/22/bias-variance-tradeoff/   As mentioned earlier, we want to know how the model will perform \\u201cin the real world.\\u201d Part of that is validation error, which is comprised of error due to bias and error due to variance (training error does not provide information on how the model will perform on future datasets, and can be set aside for now). Minimizing model validation error requires finding the point of model complexity where the combination of bias and variance error is minimized, as shown in the linked visual. As model complexity increases, error due to bias decreases, while error due to variance increases, creating the bias-variance trade-off, which we will seek to address later with various methods of cross validation. Now let\\u2019s define bias and variance:  Bias  Bias is the error resulting from the difference between the expected value(s) of a model and the actual (or \\u201ccorrect\\u201d) value(s) for which we want to predict over multiple iterations. In the scientific concepts of accuracy and precision, bias is very similar to accuracy.

Clearly, 4,200 is an impressive improvement over 40,000.  Now think bigger. Imagine splitting the original array into groups of two and then sorting them. In the end, it would take about 1,000-time units to sort the array.  That's how merge sort works. It makes sorting a big array easy and hence it's suitable for large integer and string arrays. Time Complexity of the mergesort algorithm is the same in the best, average and worst-case and it's equal to O(n*log(n))  Btw, if you are new to Algorithms and Data Structure and not familiar with an essential sorting and searching algorithms like quicksort, binary search, level order search etc then I suggest you go through a good, comprehensive online course like Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java to learn the basics first.

        "prompt": "# Question\ni want example \n\n# Answer\nSure! Let's say we have the number `91535315` as the input.\n\n1. The function `most_repeated_digit` is called with `num` as `91535315`.\n\n2. The `digitCount` object is initialized as an empty object `{}`.\n\n3. The number `91535315` is converted to a string and stored in the `numStr` variable.\n\n4. The first loop starts, and the variable `i` is set to 0.\n\n5. The second loop starts, and the variable `j` is set to `i + 1`, which is 1.\n\n6. The condition `numStr[i] === numStr[j]` is checked. In this case, `numStr[0]` is `9` and `numStr[1]` is `1`, so the condition is false.\n\n7. Since the condition is false, the code inside the if statement is not executed.\n\n8. The second loop continues, and `j` is incremented to 2.\n\n9. The condition `numStr[i] === numStr[j]` is checked. In this case, `numStr[0]` is `9` and `numStr[2]` is `5`, so the condition is false.\n\n10. The second loop continues until it has compared all digits with the current digit at index `i`.\n\n11. The first loop continues, and `i` is incremented to 1.\n\n12. The second loop starts again, and `j` is set to `i + 1`, which is 2.\n\n13. The condition `numStr[i] === numStr[j]` is checked. In this case, `numStr[1]` is `1` and `numStr[2]` is `5`, so the condition is false.\n\n14. The second loop continues until it has compared all digits with the current digit at index `i`.\n\n15. The first loop continues until it has iterated over all digits in the number.\n\n16. The `digitCount` object now contains the count of each digit that is repeated in the number. In this case, it would be `{ \"5\": 2, \"3\": 2 }`.\n\n17. The `maxCount` variable is initialized as 0.\n\n18. The `mostRepeatedDigit` variable is initialized as null.\n\n19. The loop iterates over each digit in the `digitCount` object.\n\n20. The condition `digitCount[digit] > maxCount` is checked. In this case, `digitCount[\"5\"]` is 2, which is greater than `maxCount` (0).\n\n21. The `mostRepeatedDigit` is updated to `\"5\"` and `maxCount` is updated to 2.\n\n22. The loop continues until it has checked all digits in the `digitCount` object.\n\n23. The function returns the value of `mostRepeatedDigit`, which is `\"5\"` in this case.\n\n24. The result is assigned to the variable `most_repeated_digit_result`.\n\n25. The result is displayed as \"Most repeated digit: 5\" using `document.write()`.\n\nSo, in this example, the most repeated digit in the number `91535315` is `5`.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Math.random() - JavaScript | MDN\", \"url\": \"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random\", \"content\": \"Try it     Syntax     Return value  A floating-point, pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

Read the input values for N, L, and W.\n2. Read the array of coordinates xi.\n3. Initialize a variable count to 0 to keep track of the number of wallpaper strips needed.\n4. Initialize a variable prev to 0 to keep track of the previous coordinate.\n5. Iterate over the array of coordinates xi.\n   - Calculate the gap between the current coordinate and the previous coordinate: gap = xi - prev.\n   - Calculate the number of wallpaper strips needed to cover the gap: strips = ceil(gap / W).\n   - Add the number of strips to the count.\n   - Update the previous coordinate to xi.\n6. Calculate the remaining gap between the last coordinate and the end of the wall: remaining = L - xi - W.\n7. Calculate the number of wallpaper strips needed to cover the remaining gap: strips = ceil(remaining / W).\n8. Add the number of strips to the count.\n9. Print the value of count as the minimum number of wallpaper strips needed.\n\nHere's the Java code to implement the solution:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\nimport java.lang.Math;\n\npublic class Wallpaper {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        int N = scanner.nextInt();\n        long L = scanner.nextLong();\n        long W = scanner.nextLong();\n\n        long[] xi = new long[N];\n        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n            xi[i] = scanner.nextLong();\n        }\n\n        long count = 0;\n        long prev = 0;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n            long gap = xi[i] - prev;\n            long strips = (long) Math.ceil((double) gap / W);\n            count += strips;\n            prev = xi[i];\n        }\n\n        long remaining = L - xi[N - 1] - W;\n        long strips = (long) Math.ceil((double) remaining / W);\n        count += strips;\n\n        System.out.println(count);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can run this code and provide the input values to get the minimum number of wallpaper strips needed to cover the remaining wall.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"Java\\u2122 SE Development Kit 17, 17.0.6 Release Notes\", \"url\": \"https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/17-0-6-relnotes.html\", \"content\": \"I.e. all updates of the same release must share one installation directory.

The main conclusion of the present work is that Chilean university professors need pedagogical training on digital resources, which will allow for the development of their digital competence. Along this line, it should be indicated that the educators in general demand training, but afterwards there is a decrease in the number of educators that link their professional development with the demand of theoretical-practical training that will allow them to update their methodologies. The social and professional demand of today imply that the professors possess digital skills and competencies and are able to transform the knowledge transmitted to the students through the use of diverse digital resources. On the other hand, it was verified that the university institutions are responsible for implementing a training program that allows the educators to place value on the pedagogic usefulness of said resources if they want to be at the forefront of higher education. In this sense, it established that the participating professors have a more technological view on the use of the ICT in the classroom as opposed to a pedagogical one, and this is reason why this variable should be utilized in the training processes implemented by the institutions.

These studies have unraveled the potential influences of various ICT factors on students\\u2019 academic performance in different domains. Despite the substantial efforts in understanding the relationship of ICT and student learning, more research along this line is needed for two reasons. First, previous research has mainly focused on identifying school- (e.g., school ICT availability) and student-level (student ICT use at home) ICT factors that might influence student academic performance (Balanskat, Blamire, & Kefala, 2006; Condie & Munro, 2007; Cox et al., 2003; Zhao & Frank, 2003) without taking into account of nation-level ICT factors. National ICT development level can not only influence school and family ICT richness and educational stakeholders' ICT competence (ITU, 2015; Skryabin et al., 2015), but also act as an important stimulus for educational reforms (Bocconi, Kampylis, & Punie, 2012; Kozma, 2005; OECD, 2017b). However, despite the importance of nation-level ICT factors, little research has been conducted that incorporated the effect of country-level ICT factors into the picture in understanding the impact of ICT on student academic success. Second, the ICT landscape has gone through drastic changes in recent years and it is necessary to constantly monitor the effect of ICT-related factors on student academic performance. According to OECD statistics, among its member countries, the average percentage of households with internet access at home increased from 74% in 2012 to 88% in 2017 (OECD.Stat, 2018). Student access to ICT at schools and homes has also become more convenient due to the increase in national ICT investment and the decline in the prices of ICT facilities (Istance & Kools, 2013). Student computer ratio at schools is also increasing for most countries (especially for developing countries) except those already with almost all students owning computers (OECD, 2015).\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"The relationship between ICT and student literacy in mathematics, reading, and science across 44 countries: A multilevel analysis\", \"url\": \"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131518301416\", \"content\": \"Specifically, we: (1) conceptualize ICT as multi-level (national-, school-, and student-level) constructs to comprehensively unravel the influential pattern of ICT on student learning attainment; and (2) employ the latest PISA data (PISA 2015 database) encompassing 44 countries to present state-of-the-art evidence about the relation between ICT and student academic performance. Section snippets  National ICT development and academic achievement The development of ICT at the national level has a direct influence on education (Hanna, 2003; Heinz, 2016; Skryabin et al., 2015). The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) proposed a three-level model of ICT integration into educational systems (UIS, 2009). This model comprises the availability of ICT, the depth and breadth of ICT use and the outcomes and effects of ICT use in education. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) proposed an ICT   Data The main data source for this study was PISA 2015, an international large-scale assessment that measured 15-year-old students\\u2019 mathematics, reading, and scientific literacy. A total of 72 countries and regions participated in PISA 2015. The ICT familiarity questionnaire and student background questionnaire completed by students as well as school questionnaire completed by principals were used together to obtain student and school contextual information. Since the ICT familarity questionnaire   Results The results of the null models showed that country-, school-, and student-level variance in mathematics literacy were 30.54%, 27.00%, and 42.46% respectively (see Table 2); country-, school-, and student-level variance in reading literacy were 21.18%, 31.46%, 47.36% respectively; and country-, school-, and student-level variance in scientific literacy were 24.96%, 29.50%, and 45.54% respectively. Since school- and country-level variances accounted for a considerable proportion of the total   Discussion In this study, we examine the relationship between national-, school-, and student-level ICT factors and student mathematics, reading, and scientific literacy. The results indicated that ICT explained considerable variance in student academic performance (especially at the national- and school-levels); besides, different ICT factors showed diverse influential patterns on student learning outcomes.\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"The relationship between ICT and student literacy in mathematics, reading, and science across 44 countries: A multilevel analysis\", \"url\": \"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131518301416\", \"content\": \"Second, the ICT landscape has gone through drastic changes in recent years and it is necessary to constantly monitor the effect of ICT-related factors on student academic performance.

Student computer ratio at schools is also increasing for most countries (especially for developing countries) except those already with almost all students owning computers (OECD, 2015). As ICT may either benefit students\\u2019 learning or distract students from learning, it remains to be seen whether the increased access to ICT at home and at schools could augment or impede student academic achievement. Furthermore, new and revolutionary ICT products are getting normalized in the education (Johnson et al., 2014). Taking social media for example, as Twitter becomes ubiquitous nowadays, it is also widely used by teachers and students for educational purposes (e.g., communication, collaboration, assessment, and so on) (Tang & Hew, 2017). Thus, the constant changes in ICT landscape make it necessary and important to revisit the relationship of ICT with student learning. The present study examines the relationship between ICT and student mathematics, reading, and scientific literacy.

        "prompt": "# Question\nHow dns system working \n\n# Answer\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) works by translating human-readable domain names (like `www.example.com`) into numerical IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`) that computers use to connect to each other on the internet. Here's a simplified step-by-step explanation of how DNS works:\n\n1. **Query Initiation**: When you type a URL into your web browser, your computer (known as the \"resolver\") starts a DNS query to find the IP address associated with the domain name.\n\n2. **Recursive Query to Local DNS Server**: The resolver sends a query to a DNS server configured by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This server attempts to resolve the domain name by checking its cache for a recent lookup of the same domain. If it's not in the cache, the server performs a recursive query on behalf of the resolver.\n\n3. **Root Name Server**: If the local DNS server does not have the information, it queries one of the root name servers. The root server doesn't know the IP address for the domain but can direct the query to a Top-Level Domain (TLD) server (e.g., `.com`, `.net`, `.org`).\n\n4. **TLD Server**: The TLD server holds information about the authoritative name servers for the specific domain. It responds with the address of the domain\u2019s authoritative name server.\n\n5. **Authoritative Name Server**: The local DNS server then queries the authoritative name server, which holds the IP address records for the domain. The authoritative server responds with the IP address of the domain.\n\n6. **Response to Resolver**: The local DNS server caches the response (to improve efficiency for future queries) and sends the IP address back to the resolver (your computer).\n\n7. **Browser Connection**: With the IP address, your browser can now initiate a connection to the web server hosting the website at the domain name you initially requested, and the web page can be loaded.\n\nThis process involves multiple steps and servers, but it typically happens in milliseconds. DNS caching at various points in the process (e.g., your operating system, browser, and DNS servers) helps speed up the resolution of frequently accessed domain names.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"How DNS works\", \"url\": \"https://howdns.works/\", \"content\": \"A fun and colorful explanation of how DNS works.

Add a media query to target devices with a maximum width of 600px (typical for mobile devices):\n```css\n@media (max-width: 600px) {\n  /* CSS rules for mobile devices */\n  body {\n    /* Add styles to restrict access for Windows or tablets */\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. Inside the media query, you can add styles to restrict access for Windows or tablets. One way to do this is by adding a message or hiding the content:\n```css\n@media (max-width: 600px) {\n  /* CSS rules for mobile devices */\n  body {\n    /* Add styles to restrict access for Windows or tablets */\n    background-color: #f2f2f2; /* Change background color to indicate restricted access */\n    pointer-events: none; /* Disable pointer events to prevent interaction */\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote: The above code will disable pointer events for the entire page, including all elements. If you want to restrict access to specific elements, you can add a class or ID to those elements and target them in the CSS.\n\nRemember to place the media query inside the `<style>` tag in the HTML file.\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"web-client/main.js at 03cd199560496dff7664a4f0d2fbdd382810caec \\u00b7 cryptee/web-client\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/cryptee/web-client/blob/03cd199560496dff7664a4f0d2fbdd382810caec/source/js/main.js#L256\", \"content\": \"  var warningTitleCSS = 'color:red; font-size:60px; font-weight: bold; font-family:Montserrat; letter-spacing:5px;';   var warningDescCSS = 'font-size: 18px; font-family:Montserrat;';   console.log(\\\"%cThis is a browser feature intended for developers. \\\\n\\\\nIf someone told you to copy and paste something here to enable a Cryptee feature or \\\\\\\"hack\\\\\\\" someone's account, it is a scam and will give them access to your Cryptee account. \\\", warningDescCSS);   $(\\\".modal.is-active\\\").find(\\\".theStatus\\\").html(\\\"\\\").hide();   $(\\\".modal.is-active\\\").find(\\\"#ghost-folder-confirm-button\\\").prop(\\\"disabled\\\", true);\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"web-client/main.js at 03cd199560496dff7664a4f0d2fbdd382810caec \\u00b7 cryptee/web-client\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/cryptee/web-client/blob/03cd199560496dff7664a4f0d2fbdd382810caec/source/js/main.js#L256\", \"content\": \"don't trust the current one you've in cache.   if (location.origin.indexOf(\\\"crypt.ee\\\") !== -1) {   // this allows for beta to get updates from beta, and prod from prod.   var now = (new Date()).getTime(); // milliseconds   url: updateOrigin + \\\"/v.json?cachebuster=\\\" + now,   if (serverDeployVersion !== latestDeployVersion) {   $(\\\"body\\\").append(\\\"<div id='update-available' onclick='reloadForNewVersion();'><img src='../assets/cryptee-logo-w.svg' alt='Cryptee Logo' id='update-logo'><b>New version available</b><br>Click here to reload and install</div>\\\");\"}, {\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"JavaScript Code Snippets\", \"url\": \"https://blog.aunyks.com/notes/code-snippets/javascript#request-access-to-ethereum-wallet\", \"content\": \"This code should be in a file titled mytest.test.js, and it can be ran by executing the jest command in the terminal.

        "prompt": "# Question\nhow does a mutex work in python?\n\n# Answer\nA mutex in Python works by allowing only one thread to access a shared resource at a time. Here is how a mutex works in Python using the `threading` module:\n\n- A mutex is implemented using a `Lock` object from the `threading` module.\n- To acquire the mutex (lock), a thread calls the `acquire()` method on the `Lock` object.\n- If the mutex is available, the thread acquires it and continues execution.\n- If the mutex is already held by another thread, the calling thread will block until the mutex is released.\n- Once the thread is done with the shared resource, it releases the mutex by calling the `release()` method on the `Lock` object.\n- Releasing the mutex allows other threads to acquire it and access the shared resource.\n\nHere is a simple example demonstrating the use of a mutex in Python:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\n# Create a Lock object\nmutex = threading.Lock()\n\ndef shared_resource():\n    # Acquire the mutex\n    mutex.acquire()\n    \n    # Access the shared resource\n    print(\"Accessing the shared resource\")\n    \n    # Release the mutex\n    mutex.release()\n\n# Create two threads accessing the shared resource\nthread1 = threading.Thread(target=shared_resource)\nthread2 = threading.Thread(target=shared_resource)\n\n# Start the threads\nthread1.start()\nthread2.start()\n\n# Wait for the threads to finish\nthread1.join()\nthread2.join()\n```\n\n# Metadata\n[{\"type\": \"SEARCH_RESULT\", \"title\": \"16.2. threading \\u00e2 Higher-level threading interface\\u00c2\\u00b6\", \"url\": \"https://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.html\", \"content\": \"particular change of state call wait() repeatedly until they see the desired state, while threads that modify the state call notify() or notifyAll() when they change the state in such a way that it could possibly be a desired state for one of the waiters.

A constraint is basically a rule associated with a column that the data entered into that column must follow. For example, a \\u201cunique\\u201d constraint specifies that no two records can have the same value in a particular column. They must all be unique. The other two most popular constraints are \\u201cnot null\\u201d which specifies that a column can\\u2019t be left blank, and \\u201cprimary key\\u201d. A \\u201cprimary key\\u201d constraint defines a unique identification of each record (or row) in a table. It\\u2019s now time for you to design and create your own table.
