Modify the necessary variables in the Java code to match your IBM MQ configuration:\n   - Host name or IP address\n   - Listener port for your queue manager\n   - Channel name\n   - Queue manager name\n   - User name that application uses to connect to MQ\n   - Password that the application uses to connect to MQ\n   - Queue name that the application uses to put and get messages to and from\n\n2. Add the following code snippet to set the SSL cipher suite in your Java code:\n   ```java\n   cf.setStringProperty(WMQConstants.WMQ_SSL_CIPHER_SUITE, \"*TLS12\");\n   ```\n\n3. Run your Java application with the necessary SSL truststore properties:\n   ```java\n   java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=clientTruststore.p12 -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=passw0rd -cp .\\com.ibm.mq.allclient-9.2.2.0.jar;.\\javax.jms-api-2.0.1.jar;. com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.JmsPut\n   ```\n\nPlease refer to the GitHub repository \"ibm-messaging/mq-dev-samples\" for more detailed information and code examples on connecting to IBM MQ with SSL using Java.",

Modify the necessary variables in the Java code to match your IBM MQ configuration:\n   - Host name or IP address\n   - Listener port for your queue manager\n   - Channel name\n   - Queue manager name\n   - User name that application uses to connect to MQ\n   - Password that the application uses to connect to MQ\n   - Queue name that the application uses to put and get messages to and from\n\n2.

Run your Java application with the necessary SSL truststore properties:\n   ```java\n   java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=clientTruststore.p12 -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=passw0rd -cp .\\com.ibm.mq.allclient-9.2.2.0.jar;.\\javax.jms-api-2.0.1.jar;. com.ibm.mq.samples.jms.JmsPut\n   ```\n\nPlease refer to the GitHub repository \"ibm-messaging/mq-dev-samples\" for more detailed information and code examples on connecting to IBM MQ with SSL using Java.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The process described involves multiple steps and interactions between the user's actions (modifying variables, setting SSL cipher suite, and running the application with SSL properties) and the system's responses (connecting to IBM MQ with SSL). A sequence diagram is best suited to illustrate the order of these operations and the interaction between the user and the system components.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

Let's ensure that the `count` value is correctly set and updated in the component and Redux state:\n\n1. **Component Update Logic**:\n   - When the component mounts, ensure that the `count` value is initialized with the correct value from the Redux state.\n   - When the `select` element's value changes, make sure the `count` state is updated using `setCount` with the selected number.\n\n2. **Redux State Update**:\n   - Confirm that the `updateNum` action is dispatched correctly with the selected number.\n   - Check if the `updateNum` action updates the `count` value in the Redux state as expected.\n\n3. **Troubleshooting Steps**:\n   - Add `console.log` statements in the component to track the `count` value changes and ensure it reflects the selected number.\n   - Verify that the `updateNum` action is dispatched with the correct values when the `select` element value changes.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue further:\n\n- **Component Initialization**:\n  - Add a `console.log` statement to check the initial value of `count` in the component when it mounts.\n\n- **Dispatch Action**:\n  - Add a `console.log` statement inside the `updateNum` action to see if it receives the correct value when dispatched.\n\n- **Redux State Update**:\n  - Check the Redux DevTools to see if the `count` value is updated in the Redux state when the `updateNum` action is dispatched.\n\nBy following these steps and checking the component initialization, action dispatch, and Redux state update, you should be able to identify where the issue lies and correct it to ensure the `count` value persists correctly even after a page refresh.",

(See  Part 1: Redux Overview and Concepts  for explanations of these terms. )    Introduction\u200b  In Part 1: Redux Overview and Concepts, we looked at how Redux can help us build maintainable apps by giving us a single central place to put global app state. We also talked about core Redux concepts like dispatching action objects, using reducer functions that return new state values, and writing async logic using thunks. In Part 2: Redux App Structure, we saw how APIs like configureStore and createSlice from Redux Toolkit and Provider and useSelector from React-Redux work together to let us write Redux logic and interact with that logic from our React components. Now that you have some idea of what these pieces are, it's time to put that knowledge into practice. We're going to build a small social media feed app, which will include a number of features that demonstrate some real-world use cases. This will help you understand how to use Redux in your own applications. caution The example app is not meant as a complete production-ready project.

React Router will pass in a match object as a prop that contains the URL information we're looking for. When we set up the route to render this component, we're going to tell it to parse the second part of the URL as a variable named postId, and we can read that value from match.params.  Once we have that postId value, we can use it inside a selector function to find the right post object from the Redux store. We know that state.posts should be an array of all post objects, so we can use the Array.find() function to loop through the array and return the post entry with the ID we're looking for.  It's important to note that the component will re-render any time the value returned from useSelector changes to a new reference. Components should always try to select the smallest possible amount of data they need from the store, which will help ensure that it only renders when it actually needs to.  It's possible that we might not have a matching post entry in the store - maybe the user tried to type in the URL directly, or we don't have the right data loaded. If that happens, the find() function will return undefined instead of an actual post object. Our component needs to check for that and handle it by showing a \"Post not found!"

Adding a Users Slice\u200b  Since the concept of \"users\" is different than the concept of \"posts\", we want to keep the code and data for the users separated from the code and data for posts. We'll add a new features/users folder, and put a usersSlice file in there. Like with the posts slice, for now we'll add some initial entries so that we have data to work with. features/users/usersSlice.js   import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit' const initialState = [ { id: '0', name: 'Tianna Jenkins' }, { id: '1', name: 'Kevin Grant' }, { id: '2', name: 'Madison Price' }] const usersSlice = createSlice({ name: 'users', initialState, reducers: {}}) export default usersSlice.reducer     For now, we don't need to actually update the data, so we'll leave the reducers field as an empty object. (We'll come back to this in a later section. ) As before, we'll import the usersReducer into our store file and add it to the store setup:  app/store.js   import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit' import postsReducer from '../features/posts/postsSlice'import usersReducer from '../features/users/usersSlice' export default configureStore({ reducer: { posts: postsReducer, users: usersReducer }})     Every post in our app was written by one of our users, and every time we add a new post, we should keep track of which user wrote that post. In a real app, we'd have some sort of a state.currentUser field that keeps track of the current logged-in user, and use that information whenever they add a post. To keep things simpler for this example, we'll update our <AddPostForm> component so that we can select a user from a dropdown list, and we'll include that user's ID as part of the post. Once our post objects have a user ID in them, we can use that to look up the user's name and show it in each individual post in the UI."

Right now, we're generating the ID and creating the payload object in our React component, and passing the payload object into postAdded. But, what if we needed to dispatch the same action from different components, or the logic for preparing the payload is complicated? We'd have to duplicate that logic every time we wanted to dispatch the action, and we're forcing the component to know exactly what the payload for this action should look like.  Fortunately, createSlice lets us define a \"prepare callback\" function when we write a reducer. The \"prepare callback\" function can take multiple arguments, generate random values like unique IDs, and run whatever other synchronous logic is needed to decide what values go into the action object. It should then return an object with the payload field inside.  So far, we only have one slice of state. The logic is defined in postsSlice.js, the data is stored in state.posts, and all of our components have been related to the posts feature. Real applications will probably have many different slices of state, and several different \"feature folders\" for the Redux logic and React components."

Let's ensure that the `count` value is correctly set and updated in the component and Redux state:\n\n1. **Component Update Logic**:\n   - When the component mounts, ensure that the `count` value is initialized with the correct value from the Redux state.\n   - When the `select` element's value changes, make sure the `count` state is updated using `setCount` with the selected number.\n\n2. **Redux State Update**:\n   - Confirm that the `updateNum` action is dispatched correctly with the selected number.\n   - Check if the `updateNum` action updates the `count` value in the Redux state as expected.\n\n3. **Troubleshooting Steps**:\n   - Add `console.log` statements in the component to track the `count` value changes and ensure it reflects the selected number.\n   - Verify that the `updateNum` action is dispatched with the correct values when the `select` element value changes.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue further:\n\n- **Component Initialization**:\n  - Add a `console.log` statement to check the initial value of `count` in the component when it mounts.\n\n- **Dispatch Action**:\n  - Add a `console.log` statement inside the `updateNum` action to see if it receives the correct value when dispatched.\n\n- **Redux State Update**:\n  - Check the Redux DevTools to see if the `count` value is updated in the Redux state when the `updateNum` action is dispatched.\n\nBy following these steps and checking the component initialization, action dispatch, and Redux state update, you should be able to identify where the issue lies and correct it to ensure the `count` value persists correctly even after a page refresh.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The provided code and explanation revolve around the interactions between components and Redux actions, focusing on the sequence of operations like initializing, updating, and dispatching actions. A sequence diagram is best suited to represent these interactions and the order in which they occur, illustrating how the system components communicate over time to manage the cart state, including adding to cart, removing from cart, and updating the count. This diagram type effectively captures the dynamic behavior and sequence of events in the system.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

This way the function can be defined lower down in the file or in a different file entirely. The next thing to discuss is how we compile this little program. The simplest way to compile a project with multiple files is to tell GCC about all of the files at once: While this works, it becomes very impractical once you start getting a lot of files. Also, this requires that you build the entire project every single time you make one little change. While not a problem for small projects, this can take a lot of time when your projects start to get large. The way to get around this is to take advantage of the linker: The first two commands tell GCC to create an object file out of C source code file. The object file contains the compiled version of the code in a format that the linker can piece together into an actual executable later."

        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\nI have built a program out of 4 separate files, document how they interact with each other and how the system words please\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\n### File Interaction and System Architecture:\n\n#### Files Involved:\n1. **MemoryDatabase Class (memory_system.py):**\n   - Responsible for loading, saving, adding, updating, and retrieving entries in the memory database.\n  \n2. **ai_task_executor Class (ai_library.py):**\n   - Initializes OpenAI API key and executes AI tasks based on provided blocks.\n  \n3. **function_task_executor Class (functions_library.py):**\n   - Executes function tasks based on provided blocks.\n  \n4. **run_flow Class (main.py):**\n   - Orchestrates the processing of instructions, interacts with the MemoryDatabase, ai_task_executor, and function_task_executor classes.\n\n#### System Workflow:\n1. The `run_flow` class in `main.py`:\n   - Initializes instances of `MemoryDatabase`, `ai_task_executor`, and `function_task_executor`.\n   - Processes instructions by loading a JSON file, storing the instructions in the memory database, and executing the corresponding block based on type.\n   - Updates the memory database with the output of the executed block.\n\n2. The `MemoryDatabase` class in `memory_system.py`:\n   - Manages the database by loading, saving, adding, updating, and retrieving entries.\n  \n3. The `ai_task_executor` class in `ai_library.py`:\n   - Sets the OpenAI API key and executes AI tasks based on the provided blocks.\n\n4. The `function_task_executor` class in `functions_library.py`:\n   - Executes function tasks based on the provided blocks.\n\n#### Interaction Flow:\n1. The `run_flow` class orchestrates the entire process by interacting with the memory database, AI tasks, and function tasks.\n2. Instructions are processed, stored in the memory database, and executed based on their type (AI or function).\n3. The output of the executed block is then updated in the memory database.\n\nThis system architecture ensures a structured flow of data and tasks, allowing for the seamless execution of AI and function-based operations based on provided instructions.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The description provided outlines the interaction between different classes and files in a sequential manner, detailing how one class initializes or calls methods from another to perform tasks. A sequence diagram is best suited to represent the order of operations and the interaction between these components over time, especially since the focus is on the sequence of actions and interactions rather than the state changes of the system or the hierarchical structure of the classes.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\nWhat are some common pitfalls or issues that can arise when using mutexes?\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\nHere are some common pitfalls or issues that can arise when using mutexes based on the information provided:\n\n- Deadlocks can occur if mutexes are not released properly or if there is a circular dependency between mutexes.\n- Priority inversion can happen when a low-priority task holds a mutex needed by a high-priority task.\n- Starvation can occur if a thread is constantly being preempted before it can acquire a mutex.\n- Overuse of mutexes can lead to performance issues due to frequent context switching.\n- Improper use of mutexes can result in race conditions or incorrect program behavior.\n- Forgetting to unlock a mutex after acquiring it can lead to resource leaks or deadlock situations.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: stateDiagram\nReasoning: The answer describes various states and transitions that can occur when using mutexes, such as moving from a normal operation state to a deadlock, priority inversion, or starvation state. A state diagram is suitable for illustrating these states and the transitions between them, highlighting how different issues can arise and potentially resolve in the context of mutex usage.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> \"A state diagram is a type of diagram used in computer science and related fields to describe the behavior of systems.\n> State diagrams require that the system described is composed of a finite number of states; sometimes, this is indeed the\n> case, while at other times this is a reasonable abstraction.\" Wikipedia\n\nMermaid can render state diagrams. The syntax tries to be compliant with the syntax used in plantUml as this will make\nit easier for users to share diagrams between mermaid and plantUml.\n\n```mermaid-example\n---\ntitle: Simple sample\n---\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Still\n    Still --> [*]\n\n    Still --> Moving\n    Moving --> Still\n    Moving --> Crash\n    Crash --> [*]\n```\n\nOlder renderer:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram\n    [*] --> Still\n    Still --> [*]\n\n    Still --> Moving\n    Moving --> Still\n    Moving --> Crash\n    Crash --> [*]\n```\n\nIn state diagrams systems are described in terms of _states_ and how one _state_ can change to another _state_ via\na _transition._ The example diagram above shows three states: **Still**, **Moving** and **Crash**. You start in the\n**Still** state. From **Still** you can change to the **Moving** state. From **Moving** you can change either back to the **Still** state or to\nthe **Crash** state. There is no transition from **Still** to **Crash**. (You can't crash if you're still.)\n\n## States\n\nA state can be declared in multiple ways. The simplest way is to define a state with just an id:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    stateId\n```\n\nAnother way is by using the state keyword with a description as per below:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    state \"This is a state description\" as s2\n```\n\nAnother way to define a state with a description is to define the state id followed by a colon and the description:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s2 : This is a state description\n```\n\n## Transitions\n\nTransitions are path/edges when one state passes into another. This is represented using text arrow, \"\\-\\-\\>\".\n\nWhen you define a transition between two states and the states are not already defined, the undefined states are defined\nwith the id from the transition. You can later add descriptions to states defined this way.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s1 --> s2\n```\n\nIt is possible to add text to a transition to describe what it represents:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s1 --> s2: A transition\n```\n\n## Start and End\n\nThere are two special states indicating the start and stop of the diagram. These are written with the [\\*] syntax and\nthe direction of the transition to it defines it either as a start or a stop state.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> s1\n    s1 --> [*]\n```\n\n## Composite states\n\nIn a real world use of state diagrams you often end up with diagrams that are multidimensional as one state can\nhave several internal states. These are called composite states in this terminology.\n\nIn order to define a composite state you need to use the state keyword followed by an id and the body of the composite\nstate between \\{\\}. See the example below:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n    state First {\n        [*] --> second\n        second --> [*]\n    }\n```\n\nYou can do this in several layers:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n\n    state First {\n        [*] --> Second\n\n        state Second {\n            [*] --> second\n            second --> Third\n\n            state Third {\n                [*] --> third\n                third --> [*]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nYou can also define transitions also between composite states:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n    First --> Second\n    First --> Third\n\n    state First {\n        [*] --> fir\n        fir --> [*]\n    }\n    state Second {\n        [*] --> sec\n        sec --> [*]\n    }\n    state Third {\n        [*] --> thi\n        thi --> [*]\n    }\n```\n\n_You can not define transitions between internal states belonging to different composite states_\n\n## Choice\n\nSometimes you need to model a choice between two or more paths, you can do so using &lt;&lt;choice&gt;&gt;.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    state if_state <<choice>>\n    [*] --> IsPositive\n    IsPositive --> if_state\n    if_state --> False: if n < 0\n    if_state --> True : if n >= 0\n```\n\n## Forks\n\nIt is possible to specify a fork in the diagram using &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;join&gt;&gt;.\n\n```mermaid-example\n   stateDiagram-v2\n    state fork_state <<fork>>\n      [*] --> fork_state\n      fork_state --> State2\n      fork_state --> State3\n\n      state join_state <<join>>\n      State2 --> join_state\n      State3 --> join_state\n      join_state --> State4\n      State4 --> [*]\n```\n\n## Notes\n\nSometimes nothing says it better than a Post-it note. That is also the case in state diagrams.\n\nHere you can choose to put the note to the _right of_ or to the _left of_ a node.\n\n```mermaid-example\n    stateDiagram-v2\n        State1: The state with a note\n        note right of State1\n            Important information! You can write\n            notes.\n        end note\n        State1 --> State2\n        note left of State2 : This is the note to the left.\n```\n\n## Concurrency\n\nAs in plantUml you can specify concurrency using the -- symbol.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Active\n\n    state Active {\n        [*] --> NumLockOff\n        NumLockOff --> NumLockOn : EvNumLockPressed\n        NumLockOn --> NumLockOff : EvNumLockPressed\n        --\n        [*] --> CapsLockOff\n        CapsLockOff --> CapsLockOn : EvCapsLockPressed\n        CapsLockOn --> CapsLockOff : EvCapsLockPressed\n        --\n        [*] --> ScrollLockOff\n        ScrollLockOff --> ScrollLockOn : EvScrollLockPressed\n        ScrollLockOn --> ScrollLockOff : EvScrollLockPressed\n    }\n```\n\n## Setting the direction of the diagram\n\nWith state diagrams you can use the direction statement to set the direction which the diagram will render like in this\nexample.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram\n    direction LR\n    [*] --> A\n    A --> B\n    B --> C\n    state B {\n      direction LR\n      a --> b\n    }\n    B --> D\n```\n\n## Comments\n\nComments can be entered within a state diagram chart, which will be ignored by the parser. Comments need to be on their\nown line, and must be prefaced with `%%` (double percent signs). Any text after the start of the comment to the next\nnewline will be treated as a comment, including any diagram syntax\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Still\n    Still --> [*]\n%% this is a comment\n    Still --> Moving\n    Moving --> Still %% another comment\n    Moving --> Crash\n    Crash --> [*]\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

It is unsafe to use statics or dynamics unless you protect them with a mutex. You can use dynamics that are allocated and freed within the call but not dynamics that are allocated somewhere else. If the function contains access to peripheral registers then this access must always be protected with some kind of mechanism, a Mutex or some other way of protecting the critical section. As an example of code that needs to be reentrant let\u2019s take a look at TCP/IP Networking. The protocol stack is nothing but a library of functions and so to send a package from a user task, what we need to do is make a socket API call. From within that call, a call will be made to a TCP layer function and that in turn will make an IP layer function and it will percolate all the way down to the network driver. When it gets there the driver controls exactly one chip and for that reason it is a shared resource. So because it is a shared resource, it needs to be protected just like with any other global variable; and so somehow this code needs to be protected and it needs to be treated as a critical section."

Note that sometimes a pair of shared objects (e.g., an x, y coordinate pair) is really a single object that needs to be protected. In that case, the best practice is to combine the x coordinate and the y coordinate into a single struct and then to name the instance of that struct with a g_ and protect the pair of data points inside of it with a single mutex.   Q: How do I check if the code I use is reentrant?   If it\u2019s code you bought and you don't have source code, you will probably need to check with the vendor. If the code in question was developed in-house, code inspection as above is your best bet. Note that a set of reentrant functions to manipulate a single global or memory-mapped register set (e.g., a device driver) should create an abstraction wherein the the mutex used to protect this object is declared inside the file as a static global.   It is possible but not advisable. It could lead to a condition called a \u201cdeadly embrace\u201d where two tasks block each other forever by holding a resource and waiting for another one that the other task has.

        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\nwhat is a mutex?\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\nA mutex is a synchronization primitive used to control access to shared resources in concurrent programming. Here are some key points about mutexes based on the information provided:\n\n- A mutex allows only one thread to lock and own it at a time.\n- It is used to prevent race conditions where multiple threads access shared data concurrently.\n- When a thread locks a mutex, it becomes the owner and can access the protected resources.\n- If another thread tries to lock the mutex while it is already locked, the requesting thread will be suspended and queued until the mutex is unlocked.\n- Mutexes are commonly used to protect critical sections of code where shared data is accessed and modified by multiple threads.\n\nIf you need more specific information or code examples, please let me know!\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: stateDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation of a mutex involves describing its states (locked, unlocked) and the transitions between these states based on actions taken by threads (locking, unlocking). A state diagram is well-suited to represent these concepts because it can clearly illustrate the different states a mutex can be in and how it transitions between these states depending on the actions of threads. This makes it easier to understand the behavior of mutexes in concurrent programming.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> \"A state diagram is a type of diagram used in computer science and related fields to describe the behavior of systems.\n> State diagrams require that the system described is composed of a finite number of states; sometimes, this is indeed the\n> case, while at other times this is a reasonable abstraction.\" Wikipedia\n\nMermaid can render state diagrams. The syntax tries to be compliant with the syntax used in plantUml as this will make\nit easier for users to share diagrams between mermaid and plantUml.\n\n```mermaid-example\n---\ntitle: Simple sample\n---\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Still\n    Still --> [*]\n\n    Still --> Moving\n    Moving --> Still\n    Moving --> Crash\n    Crash --> [*]\n```\n\nOlder renderer:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram\n    [*] --> Still\n    Still --> [*]\n\n    Still --> Moving\n    Moving --> Still\n    Moving --> Crash\n    Crash --> [*]\n```\n\nIn state diagrams systems are described in terms of _states_ and how one _state_ can change to another _state_ via\na _transition._ The example diagram above shows three states: **Still**, **Moving** and **Crash**. You start in the\n**Still** state. From **Still** you can change to the **Moving** state. From **Moving** you can change either back to the **Still** state or to\nthe **Crash** state. There is no transition from **Still** to **Crash**. (You can't crash if you're still.)\n\n## States\n\nA state can be declared in multiple ways. The simplest way is to define a state with just an id:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    stateId\n```\n\nAnother way is by using the state keyword with a description as per below:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    state \"This is a state description\" as s2\n```\n\nAnother way to define a state with a description is to define the state id followed by a colon and the description:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s2 : This is a state description\n```\n\n## Transitions\n\nTransitions are path/edges when one state passes into another. This is represented using text arrow, \"\\-\\-\\>\".\n\nWhen you define a transition between two states and the states are not already defined, the undefined states are defined\nwith the id from the transition. You can later add descriptions to states defined this way.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s1 --> s2\n```\n\nIt is possible to add text to a transition to describe what it represents:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s1 --> s2: A transition\n```\n\n## Start and End\n\nThere are two special states indicating the start and stop of the diagram. These are written with the [\\*] syntax and\nthe direction of the transition to it defines it either as a start or a stop state.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> s1\n    s1 --> [*]\n```\n\n## Composite states\n\nIn a real world use of state diagrams you often end up with diagrams that are multidimensional as one state can\nhave several internal states. These are called composite states in this terminology.\n\nIn order to define a composite state you need to use the state keyword followed by an id and the body of the composite\nstate between \\{\\}. See the example below:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n    state First {\n        [*] --> second\n        second --> [*]\n    }\n```\n\nYou can do this in several layers:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n\n    state First {\n        [*] --> Second\n\n        state Second {\n            [*] --> second\n            second --> Third\n\n            state Third {\n                [*] --> third\n                third --> [*]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nYou can also define transitions also between composite states:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n    First --> Second\n    First --> Third\n\n    state First {\n        [*] --> fir\n        fir --> [*]\n    }\n    state Second {\n        [*] --> sec\n        sec --> [*]\n    }\n    state Third {\n        [*] --> thi\n        thi --> [*]\n    }\n```\n\n_You can not define transitions between internal states belonging to different composite states_\n\n## Choice\n\nSometimes you need to model a choice between two or more paths, you can do so using &lt;&lt;choice&gt;&gt;.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    state if_state <<choice>>\n    [*] --> IsPositive\n    IsPositive --> if_state\n    if_state --> False: if n < 0\n    if_state --> True : if n >= 0\n```\n\n## Forks\n\nIt is possible to specify a fork in the diagram using &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;join&gt;&gt;.\n\n```mermaid-example\n   stateDiagram-v2\n    state fork_state <<fork>>\n      [*] --> fork_state\n      fork_state --> State2\n      fork_state --> State3\n\n      state join_state <<join>>\n      State2 --> join_state\n      State3 --> join_state\n      join_state --> State4\n      State4 --> [*]\n```\n\n## Notes\n\nSometimes nothing says it better than a Post-it note. That is also the case in state diagrams.\n\nHere you can choose to put the note to the _right of_ or to the _left of_ a node.\n\n```mermaid-example\n    stateDiagram-v2\n        State1: The state with a note\n        note right of State1\n            Important information! You can write\n            notes.\n        end note\n        State1 --> State2\n        note left of State2 : This is the note to the left.\n```\n\n## Concurrency\n\nAs in plantUml you can specify concurrency using the -- symbol.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Active\n\n    state Active {\n        [*] --> NumLockOff\n        NumLockOff --> NumLockOn : EvNumLockPressed\n        NumLockOn --> NumLockOff : EvNumLockPressed\n        --\n        [*] --> CapsLockOff\n        CapsLockOff --> CapsLockOn : EvCapsLockPressed\n        CapsLockOn --> CapsLockOff : EvCapsLockPressed\n        --\n        [*] --> ScrollLockOff\n        ScrollLockOff --> ScrollLockOn : EvScrollLockPressed\n        ScrollLockOn --> ScrollLockOff : EvScrollLockPressed\n    }\n```\n\n## Setting the direction of the diagram\n\nWith state diagrams you can use the direction statement to set the direction which the diagram will render like in this\nexample.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram\n    direction LR\n    [*] --> A\n    A --> B\n    B --> C\n    state B {\n      direction LR\n      a --> b\n    }\n    B --> D\n```\n\n## Comments\n\nComments can be entered within a state diagram chart, which will be ignored by the parser. Comments need to be on their\nown line, and must be prefaced with `%%` (double percent signs). Any text after the start of the comment to the next\nnewline will be treated as a comment, including any diagram syntax\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Still\n    Still --> [*]\n%% this is a comment\n    Still --> Moving\n    Moving --> Still %% another comment\n    Moving --> Crash\n    Crash --> [*]\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

It's the least secure of the acceptable password hashing algorithms on this page, so we aren't going to provide any example code. On a technical level, they're vastly different, but for practical purposes they're morally equivalent. The real weakness is in not using an acceptable password hashing function at all. If you can use either of these two, use it. They're both fine.

        "system": "Your task is to build a mermaidJS diagram to help users visualize an answer provided to question they did. You'll be provided the \"Question\", the \"Answer\", the \"DiagramType\" and the \"DiagramTypeDocs\"\nYour output will be parsed and validate so you must reply with VALID mermaidJS code only and in the following format:\n```mermaid\n{ diagram }\n```\n\nPrefer diagrams with simple syntax\nAvoid styling on the diagram\nEscape characters when needed\nMake sure that you don't use any forbidden mermaid characters\nMake sure to below the instructions and examples in the syntax documentation\nYou MUST produce valid mermaidJS syntax!\n",
        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\nHow to hash a password in php\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\n### PHP\n\nTo hash a password securely in PHP, you can use the `password_hash` function. Here's a basic example:\n\n```php\n$password = \"user_password_here\";\n$hashed_password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n```\n\nThis will generate a secure hash of the password using the default algorithm. Make sure to store the hashed password in your database.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: A sequence diagram is most appropriate here because the process of hashing a password in PHP involves a sequence of steps: receiving the plain password, hashing it using a specific function, and then storing the hashed password. This sequence of operations and the interaction between the user's input and the PHP function can be effectively illustrated using a sequence diagram.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

An example could be that when testing a login function for a negative response, is a good idea to test each error message in the same test class, and not create a different test class for each error message. 11. Create Assertions  Each step should also have the actual and expected result side by side, thus the tester can compare if the actual result is the same with the expected result. This applies for the manual and the automated test, since a test automation engineer should make as many assertions (which are relevant to the test) as possible. So, add assertions to each actions to make sure it works properly. E.g:  Assert.assertEquals(loginPage.getGeneralError(),generalError,\"Warning: No match for E-Mail Address and/or Password. \")   12. Execute Your Test  After the automated tests are written, you can run your tests in different ways: directly from your favorite IDE by selecting the class with all the tests or just one test, from the command line (with TestNG or JUnit), with Jenkins, or any other continuous integration tool, when you create your job that also runs based on a command line or with BlazeMeter."

These actions will be executed when the user starts the automated test. Creating and Running Your Automated Selenium UI Tests  10. Writing your Tests  Every test, be it manual or automated, usually has the following structure: Preconditions Before executing a test, one has to bring the application to a state that the test can be executed from. For example, changing the process status. This is usually done by altering values in the database instead of making hundreds of clicks on the website. Create Test Steps The core of every test, or the body of a test, describes the flow that is required to follow the target.

After each important step, alongside the screenshots, the description of the steps should be added to the logs. This way the tester will not only see the where the test failed with the help of the screenshot, but also what caused the error or bug to happen by having the logs collected. This will help every tester who runs the tests, as sometimes the stack trace is not clear enough because it may show on which step the test failed, but not the actual cause.

A sequence diagram is most appropriate here as it can effectively illustrate the order of these operations and the interaction between the system components involved in the login process.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

        "answer": "Certainly! Here is a sample code snippet in PHP using CodeIgniter 3 to retrieve session data after redirection:\n\n```php\n// Set session data before redirection\n$this->session->set_userdata('user_id', 123);\n$this->session->set_userdata('username', 'john_doe');\n\n// Redirect to another page\nredirect('dashboard');\n\n// In the 'dashboard' controller method\npublic function index()\n{\n    // Retrieve session data after redirection\n    $user_id = $this->session->userdata('user_id');\n    $username = $this->session->userdata('username');\n\n    // Use the retrieved session data as needed\n    echo \"User ID: \" . $user_id;\n    echo \"Username: \" . $username;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n- We first set some session data (`user_id` and `username`) before redirecting to the `dashboard` page.\n- After the redirection, in the `dashboard` controller method (e.g., `index()` method), we retrieve the session data using `$this->session->userdata('key')`.\n- Finally, we can use the retrieved session data (`user_id` and `username`) as needed in the `dashboard` page.\n\nThis code demonstrates how you can retrieve session data after redirection in CodeIgniter 3.",

On the other hand, you can also mark an existing session variable as a flashdata variable. In that case, you need to use the\u00a0mark_as_flash method, as shown in the above code. Finally, we redirect the user to the\u00a0getflash method that shows how to use flashdata variables that were set in the\u00a0setflash method. Let's have a quick look at the\u00a0getflash method. As expected, there's a flashdata method that allows you to fetch session variables stored as flashdata. If you call the\u00a0flashdata method without any arguments, it'll return all flashdata variables similar to that of the userdata\u00a0method. Go ahead and test the\u00a0setflash method. You'll be redirected to the\u00a0getflash URL, and you'll see the message. If you refresh the getflash page, you won't see that message again!"

Now, let's see how to retrieve the value of any session variable. The userdata method is used to retrieve the value of any session variable, and usually it needs the key of the session variable that you're looking for as the first argument.  echo \"Favourite Website: \". $this->session->userdata('favourite_website'); If you're looking for one of the array entries, you can use the\u00a0following:  echo \"Interest (Array Example): \" . $this->session->userdata('interests'); More often than not, you want to know how many variables in total are stored in an active session for debugging purposes, and you can do that as well.

        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\nso can you give me ssmple of code using sesseion retrieval after redirection\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\nCertainly! Here is a sample code snippet in PHP using CodeIgniter 3 to retrieve session data after redirection:\n\n```php\n// Set session data before redirection\n$this->session->set_userdata('user_id', 123);\n$this->session->set_userdata('username', 'john_doe');\n\n// Redirect to another page\nredirect('dashboard');\n\n// In the 'dashboard' controller method\npublic function index()\n{\n    // Retrieve session data after redirection\n    $user_id = $this->session->userdata('user_id');\n    $username = $this->session->userdata('username');\n\n    // Use the retrieved session data as needed\n    echo \"User ID: \" . $user_id;\n    echo \"Username: \" . $username;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n- We first set some session data (`user_id` and `username`) before redirecting to the `dashboard` page.\n- After the redirection, in the `dashboard` controller method (e.g., `index()` method), we retrieve the session data using `$this->session->userdata('key')`.\n- Finally, we can use the retrieved session data (`user_id` and `username`) as needed in the `dashboard` page.\n\nThis code demonstrates how you can retrieve session data after redirection in CodeIgniter 3.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation involves a sequence of operations starting with setting session data, redirecting to another page, and then retrieving the session data on the new page. A sequence diagram is ideal for illustrating the order of these operations and how they interact with each other over time, making it the most appropriate choice for visualizing this process.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

Add Sign up and Sign in Now you're going to add sign up and sign in forms, and build a \"protected\" page, that only signed in users can see. You will first need to add the @clerk/nextjs to your project. Clerk brings a ton of authentication capabilities to  Next.js , but for this tutorial we'll just set up the basics of sign-up and sign-in. In your terminal, at the root directory of your project, install the @clerk/nextjs package with the following command:  Note: this tutorial will be using the latest alpha release, so make sure you're on at least version >=3.0    npm install @clerk/nextjs@next   Now you need environment variables to link your local development with your Clerk instance. You can find your API keys on the home page, in the \"Connect your application\" section. In your project\u2019s root directory, create a file named .env.local . Next.js will automatically load all environment variables set here, into your application."

        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\nim using Supabase auth in my Nitro / Nuxt project. How do i integrate 'forgot password'? FYI: Everything is SSR and I already have a Nitro plugin for Supabase. \n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\nTo integrate a \"forgot password\" feature in your Nitro / Nuxt project using Supabase Auth, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Client-Side Setup:**\n   - Create a form in your Nuxt project where users can input their email to request a password reset.\n   - When the form is submitted, call a function that triggers the password reset process.\n  \n2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Setup:**\n   - Ensure that your Nitro plugin for Supabase is properly configured to handle server-side requests.\n   - Implement a server-side function to handle the password reset request.\n   - Use Supabase's `supabase.auth.api.resetPasswordForEmail` method to initiate the password reset process.\n\n3. **Password Reset Process:**\n   - When a user requests a password reset, call the server-side function to trigger the `resetPasswordForEmail` method.\n   - This method will send a password reset email to the user's email address with instructions on how to reset their password.\n   - Ensure that the email contains a link to a page where users can securely reset their password.\n\nBy following these steps, you can integrate a \"forgot password\" feature in your Nitro / Nuxt project using Supabase Auth.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: A sequence diagram is the most appropriate choice for illustrating the process of integrating a 'forgot password' feature because it involves interactions between the user, the client-side (Nuxt project), and the server-side (Nitro plugin and Supabase Auth). The sequence diagram can effectively show the order of operations, from the user requesting a password reset to the server handling the request and Supabase sending a reset email. This diagram type highlights the sequence of interactions and the flow of information, which is crucial for understanding the integration process.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

Here is a breakdown of the HTML code:\n\n- **Title and Meta Tags**: Sets the title of the page and defines the character set and viewport.\n- **Styling**: Applies basic styling to the body and form elements.\n- **Form**: Contains input fields for temperature and a dropdown for selecting the temperature scale.\n- **Script**: Contains JavaScript functions to calculate wind chill, convert temperature scales, and handle form submission.\n- **Event Listener**: Listens for form submission, prevents the default form submission behavior, and calculates wind chill based on user input.\n- **Result Display**: Displays the wind chill results for different wind speeds based on the user's input.\n\nThis HTML code creates a functional Wind Chill Calculator web page. Users can enter the temperature, choose the scale, and see the wind chill results for various wind speeds.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The sequence of operations and interactions between the user, the form, and the JavaScript functions is central to understanding how the Wind Chill Calculator works. A sequence diagram is ideal for illustrating the flow of events from the user submitting the form, through the calculation of wind chill (including the potential conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit), to displaying the results. This diagram type effectively captures the order of operations and the interactions between different components (user, form, JavaScript functions) in a clear, sequential manner.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

Here's how you can modify the code:\n\n```csharp\n@if (selectedType == \"Internal\")\n{\n    <DxComboBox Data=\"@payee\"\n                TextFieldName=\"@nameof(PayeeView_.FullName)\"\n                FilteringMode=\"FilteringMode\"\n                AllowUserInput=\"false\"\n                NullText=\"Select...\"\n                CssClass=\"cw-240\"\n                SizeMode=\"SizeMode.Medium\"\n                Value=\"@payeeName\"\n                ValueChanged=\"@((PayeeView_ selectedTitle) => { FilterPayee(selectedTitle); selectedType = \"Internal\"; Submit(); })\" />\n}\nelse if (selectedType == \"Person\")\n{\n    <!-- Add the necessary code for Person type here -->\n}\nelse\n{\n    <!-- Add the necessary code for the default case here -->\n}\n```\n\nBy updating the `ValueChanged` event handler in the `<DxComboBox>`, you can ensure that the `Submit()` method is called after setting the `selectedType` based on the condition. This way, the `Submit()` method will be executed with the appropriate logic based on the selected type before closing the modal.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation provided outlines a process where an action in the UI (selecting a value from a dropdown) triggers a sequence of operations in the backend (the Submit method). This involves interaction between UI components and backend logic, following a specific order of operations based on user input. A sequence diagram is best suited to represent this interaction and the order in which these operations occur, illustrating the flow from the UI event to the backend processing.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\nWhat a callback is used for. in rails \n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\n### Rails Callbacks: 5 Best Practices Used at Gusto\n- Callbacks in Rails are used to bind actions to the lifecycle of models, known as ActiveRecord objects.\n- They allow you to trigger logic before or after an alteration of an object's state.\n- Callbacks ensure that anyone updating or saving a record won't forget to perform an operation that should be performed on #save.\n- They are often used in tandem with validations to ensure that an object enters or leaves the database exactly as desired.\n- Callbacks operate directly with ActiveRecord methods that create, save, update, or destroy records in a database.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: A sequence diagram is the most appropriate choice here because the explanation of callbacks in Rails involves describing how they interact with the lifecycle of ActiveRecord objects and the database operations (create, save, update, destroy). This involves a sequence of operations and interactions that are best represented in a sequence diagram, showing the order and flow of these operations and how callbacks are triggered before or after certain actions.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

You'll be provided the \"Question\", the \"Answer\", the \"DiagramType\" and the \"DiagramTypeDocs\"\nYour output will be parsed and validate so you must reply with VALID mermaidJS code only and in the following format:\n```mermaid\n{ diagram }\n```\n\nPrefer diagrams with simple syntax\nAvoid styling on the diagram\nEscape characters when needed\nMake sure that you don't use any forbidden mermaid characters\nMake sure to below the instructions and examples in the syntax documentation\nYou MUST produce valid mermaidJS syntax!\n",
        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\nHow can event binding be used to trigger the Submit method in Blazor?\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\nTo trigger the `Submit()` method in Blazor using event binding, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Add an Event Handler in the Razor Component**:\n   - Define a method in your component that will call the `Submit()` method.\n\n2. **Bind the Event in the Razor Component**:\n   - Bind the defined method to an event in your component, such as a button click event.\n\nHere's how you can use event binding to trigger the `Submit()` method in Blazor:\n\n```csharp\n// Define an event handler method in your component\nprivate async Task OnSubmitButtonClick()\n{\n    await Submit();\n}\n\n// Bind the event handler method to a button click event in your Razor component\n<button @onclick=\"OnSubmitButtonClick\">Submit</button>\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The `OnSubmitButtonClick()` method is defined to call the `Submit()` method asynchronously.\n- The `@onclick` directive is used to bind the `OnSubmitButtonClick()` method to the button's click event. When the button is clicked, the `Submit()` method will be triggered.\n\nBy using event binding in this way, you can trigger the `Submit()` method in Blazor when a specific event, such as a button click, occurs in your component.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation describes a sequence of actions that occur when a button is clicked in a Blazor application, leading to the triggering of a Submit method. A sequence diagram is appropriate here because it can effectively illustrate the interaction between the user action (clicking the button) and the system's response (executing the Submit method). This diagram type is well-suited for showing the order of operations and the flow of control in response to events, which is exactly what the explanation outlines.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

An independent server-mode collection is created as a data source for a lookup ListView when the IModelListView.DataAccessMode option is set to Server, ServerView, InstantFeedback, or InstantFeedbackView for that ListView model. However, when the DataSourcePropertyAttribute is applied for the lookup property, the property pointed in the attribute is used as a lookup data source, and the standalone independent server-mode collection is not created and is not used at all. The reason is that the data source property getter contains logic calculated on the client side and the data source is populated by the client application at the moment when the lookup editor requests to display objects. So, the Server, ServerView, InstantFeedback, or InstantFeedbackView mode option and the DataSourceProperty attribute do not work simultaneously. "

You may need to adjust the code based on your specific requirements and the framework you are using.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The answer describes a process involving interactions between components (a modal component, a parent component, and a DxComboBox) and user actions (selecting a payee type, filtering payees, updating the DxComboBox). A sequence diagram is best suited to illustrate these interactions and the order in which they occur, showing how the system components operate with one another over time.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

Please run this program in your local as the playground is deterministic and the race condition will not occur in the playground. Run this program multiple times in your local machine and you can see that the output will be different for each time because of race condition.  Some of the outputs which I encountered are final value of x 941, final value of x 928, final value of x 922 and so on. In the program above, we spawn 1000 Goroutines.

If the problem you are trying to solve is a better fit for mutexes then go ahead and use a mutex. Do not hesitate to use mutex if needed. If the problem seems to be a better fit for channels, then use it :).  Most Go newbies try to solve every concurrency problem using a channel as it is a cool feature of the language. This is wrong. The language gives us the option to either use Mutex or Channel and there is no wrong in choosing either. In general use channels when Goroutines need to communicate with each other and mutexes when only one Goroutine should access the critical section of code. In the case of the problem which we solved above, I would prefer to use mutex since this problem does not require any communication between the goroutines."

Let's see how this is done. func increment(wg *sync.WaitGroup, ch chan bool) {  In the program above, we have created a buffered channel of capacity 1 and this is passed to the increment Goroutine in line no. 18. This buffered channel is used to ensure that only one Goroutine access the critical section of code which increments x. This is done by passing true to the buffered channel in line no."

        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\nwhats a mutex\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\nA mutex is short for mutual exclusion. Here are some key points about mutexes based on the information provided:\n\n- Mutexes keep track of which thread has access to a variable at any given time.\n- Mutexes help avoid concurrent read/write problems where one thread is writing to a variable while another thread is reading from the same variable.\n- Mutexes are used to synchronize access to shared resources in concurrent programming.\n- In Go, mutexes are used to safely manage access to shared data among goroutines.\n- When using mutexes, a thread acquires the mutex to access a critical section of code, ensuring exclusive access to that section.\n- It is important to use mutexes when only one goroutine should access the critical section of code, while channels are used when goroutines need to communicate with each other.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: stateDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation of a mutex involves describing how it manages access to resources, including states like 'locked' and 'unlocked', and transitions between these states based on actions of different threads (e.g., acquiring or releasing the mutex). A state diagram is suitable for illustrating these states and transitions, showing how a mutex controls access to a resource among multiple threads.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> \"A state diagram is a type of diagram used in computer science and related fields to describe the behavior of systems.\n> State diagrams require that the system described is composed of a finite number of states; sometimes, this is indeed the\n> case, while at other times this is a reasonable abstraction.\" Wikipedia\n\nMermaid can render state diagrams. The syntax tries to be compliant with the syntax used in plantUml as this will make\nit easier for users to share diagrams between mermaid and plantUml.\n\n```mermaid-example\n---\ntitle: Simple sample\n---\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Still\n    Still --> [*]\n\n    Still --> Moving\n    Moving --> Still\n    Moving --> Crash\n    Crash --> [*]\n```\n\nOlder renderer:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram\n    [*] --> Still\n    Still --> [*]\n\n    Still --> Moving\n    Moving --> Still\n    Moving --> Crash\n    Crash --> [*]\n```\n\nIn state diagrams systems are described in terms of _states_ and how one _state_ can change to another _state_ via\na _transition._ The example diagram above shows three states: **Still**, **Moving** and **Crash**. You start in the\n**Still** state. From **Still** you can change to the **Moving** state. From **Moving** you can change either back to the **Still** state or to\nthe **Crash** state. There is no transition from **Still** to **Crash**. (You can't crash if you're still.)\n\n## States\n\nA state can be declared in multiple ways. The simplest way is to define a state with just an id:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    stateId\n```\n\nAnother way is by using the state keyword with a description as per below:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    state \"This is a state description\" as s2\n```\n\nAnother way to define a state with a description is to define the state id followed by a colon and the description:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s2 : This is a state description\n```\n\n## Transitions\n\nTransitions are path/edges when one state passes into another. This is represented using text arrow, \"\\-\\-\\>\".\n\nWhen you define a transition between two states and the states are not already defined, the undefined states are defined\nwith the id from the transition. You can later add descriptions to states defined this way.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s1 --> s2\n```\n\nIt is possible to add text to a transition to describe what it represents:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    s1 --> s2: A transition\n```\n\n## Start and End\n\nThere are two special states indicating the start and stop of the diagram. These are written with the [\\*] syntax and\nthe direction of the transition to it defines it either as a start or a stop state.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> s1\n    s1 --> [*]\n```\n\n## Composite states\n\nIn a real world use of state diagrams you often end up with diagrams that are multidimensional as one state can\nhave several internal states. These are called composite states in this terminology.\n\nIn order to define a composite state you need to use the state keyword followed by an id and the body of the composite\nstate between \\{\\}. See the example below:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n    state First {\n        [*] --> second\n        second --> [*]\n    }\n```\n\nYou can do this in several layers:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n\n    state First {\n        [*] --> Second\n\n        state Second {\n            [*] --> second\n            second --> Third\n\n            state Third {\n                [*] --> third\n                third --> [*]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nYou can also define transitions also between composite states:\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> First\n    First --> Second\n    First --> Third\n\n    state First {\n        [*] --> fir\n        fir --> [*]\n    }\n    state Second {\n        [*] --> sec\n        sec --> [*]\n    }\n    state Third {\n        [*] --> thi\n        thi --> [*]\n    }\n```\n\n_You can not define transitions between internal states belonging to different composite states_\n\n## Choice\n\nSometimes you need to model a choice between two or more paths, you can do so using &lt;&lt;choice&gt;&gt;.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    state if_state <<choice>>\n    [*] --> IsPositive\n    IsPositive --> if_state\n    if_state --> False: if n < 0\n    if_state --> True : if n >= 0\n```\n\n## Forks\n\nIt is possible to specify a fork in the diagram using &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;join&gt;&gt;.\n\n```mermaid-example\n   stateDiagram-v2\n    state fork_state <<fork>>\n      [*] --> fork_state\n      fork_state --> State2\n      fork_state --> State3\n\n      state join_state <<join>>\n      State2 --> join_state\n      State3 --> join_state\n      join_state --> State4\n      State4 --> [*]\n```\n\n## Notes\n\nSometimes nothing says it better than a Post-it note. That is also the case in state diagrams.\n\nHere you can choose to put the note to the _right of_ or to the _left of_ a node.\n\n```mermaid-example\n    stateDiagram-v2\n        State1: The state with a note\n        note right of State1\n            Important information! You can write\n            notes.\n        end note\n        State1 --> State2\n        note left of State2 : This is the note to the left.\n```\n\n## Concurrency\n\nAs in plantUml you can specify concurrency using the -- symbol.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Active\n\n    state Active {\n        [*] --> NumLockOff\n        NumLockOff --> NumLockOn : EvNumLockPressed\n        NumLockOn --> NumLockOff : EvNumLockPressed\n        --\n        [*] --> CapsLockOff\n        CapsLockOff --> CapsLockOn : EvCapsLockPressed\n        CapsLockOn --> CapsLockOff : EvCapsLockPressed\n        --\n        [*] --> ScrollLockOff\n        ScrollLockOff --> ScrollLockOn : EvScrollLockPressed\n        ScrollLockOn --> ScrollLockOff : EvScrollLockPressed\n    }\n```\n\n## Setting the direction of the diagram\n\nWith state diagrams you can use the direction statement to set the direction which the diagram will render like in this\nexample.\n\n```mermaid-example\nstateDiagram\n    direction LR\n    [*] --> A\n    A --> B\n    B --> C\n    state B {\n      direction LR\n      a --> b\n    }\n    B --> D\n```\n\n## Comments\n\nComments can be entered within a state diagram chart, which will be ignored by the parser. Comments need to be on their\nown line, and must be prefaced with `%%` (double percent signs). Any text after the start of the comment to the next\nnewline will be treated as a comment, including any diagram syntax\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Still\n    Still --> [*]\n%% this is a comment\n    Still --> Moving\n    Moving --> Still %% another comment\n    Moving --> Crash\n    Crash --> [*]\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

These types won\u2019t have any practical use at all, but they will provide us with plenty of opportunities to practice what we\u2019ve learned in a creative way. Addition Let\u2019s start by building Add type first, which should work like this:   type Add<A extends number, B extends number> = // to be defined type Result = Add<3, 2> // => 5   The first problem we run into is that TypeScript cannot do much with numeric literals (nor with other primitive types for that matter). TypeScript wasn\u2019t designed to be used in that way, and it\u2019s important to acknowledge its limitations. However, if we look at array types, we\u2019ll discover that we can use a spread operator, and that simple fact gives us a lot of control. With a spread operator, we can make quite a few transformations - we can concatenate arrays, get the first and last elements of the array, as well as append, prepend, and remove individual elements. As you may have already guessed, we\u2019re going to use arrays to get around the limitation with the numeric literals we mentioned. To implement our Add type, we will follow this set of steps:  convert numeric literals into tuples of the equivalent sizes concatenate the resulting arrays into a new one get the length of this array which will be equal to the sum of numeric literals  Here\u2019s a visual representation of this algorithm:    Let\u2019s start by converting numeric literals into tuples."

Closed disks which are disks that contain the points of the circle that constitutes its boundary, and Open disks which are disks that do not contain the points of the circle that constitutes its boundary. In this section, we will set up the Characterstic function of the Closed disk and draw it in a HTML5 page.

In this specific example, it increments the input, doubles it, and then decrements it. When `f(x)` is called with `x` as 10, the output will be 21.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The provided code snippet and explanation describe a sequence of operations or function calls, where one function's output is passed as input to the next function in a chain. A sequence diagram is best suited to represent the order of operations and the interaction between these functions over time, showing how the data flows from one function to another and the order in which these functions are called.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

Now, we can log in. But how about registering? That\u2019s a bit more tricky. We need to establish a connection to the SQL Server, and issue a query which inserts a new row into our table. But, before that, we should make sure that there is no one with the same username already registered :)   The logic is the same as when checking the login creditentials, but this time we only look for a matching username in our table. Now that that\u2019s out of the way, let\u2019s look into adding a new row into the DB! This is a bit complicated.

It starts with designing the form, setting properties, arranging elements, connecting to the database, handling events, and implementing validation logic. A sequence diagram is suitable for illustrating how these processes operate with one another and in what order, making it the appropriate choice for visualizing the described procedure.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

        "question": "how does a mutex work in python?",
        "answer": "A mutex in Python works by allowing only one thread to access a shared resource at a time. Here is how a mutex works in Python using the `threading` module:\n\n- A mutex is implemented using a `Lock` object from the `threading` module.\n- To acquire the mutex (lock), a thread calls the `acquire()` method on the `Lock` object.\n- If the mutex is available, the thread acquires it and continues execution.\n- If the mutex is already held by another thread, the calling thread will block until the mutex is released.\n- Once the thread is done with the shared resource, it releases the mutex by calling the `release()` method on the `Lock` object.\n- Releasing the mutex allows other threads to acquire it and access the shared resource.\n\nHere is a simple example demonstrating the use of a mutex in Python:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\n# Create a Lock object\nmutex = threading.Lock()\n\ndef shared_resource():\n    # Acquire the mutex\n    mutex.acquire()\n    \n    # Access the shared resource\n    print(\"Accessing the shared resource\")\n    \n    # Release the mutex\n    mutex.release()\n\n# Create two threads accessing the shared resource\nthread1 = threading.Thread(target=shared_resource)\nthread2 = threading.Thread(target=shared_resource)\n\n# Start the threads\nthread1.start()\nthread2.start()\n\n# Wait for the threads to finish\nthread1.join()\nthread2.join()\n```",

        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\nhow does a mutex work in python?\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\nA mutex in Python works by allowing only one thread to access a shared resource at a time. Here is how a mutex works in Python using the `threading` module:\n\n- A mutex is implemented using a `Lock` object from the `threading` module.\n- To acquire the mutex (lock), a thread calls the `acquire()` method on the `Lock` object.\n- If the mutex is available, the thread acquires it and continues execution.\n- If the mutex is already held by another thread, the calling thread will block until the mutex is released.\n- Once the thread is done with the shared resource, it releases the mutex by calling the `release()` method on the `Lock` object.\n- Releasing the mutex allows other threads to acquire it and access the shared resource.\n\nHere is a simple example demonstrating the use of a mutex in Python:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\n# Create a Lock object\nmutex = threading.Lock()\n\ndef shared_resource():\n    # Acquire the mutex\n    mutex.acquire()\n    \n    # Access the shared resource\n    print(\"Accessing the shared resource\")\n    \n    # Release the mutex\n    mutex.release()\n\n# Create two threads accessing the shared resource\nthread1 = threading.Thread(target=shared_resource)\nthread2 = threading.Thread(target=shared_resource)\n\n# Start the threads\nthread1.start()\nthread2.start()\n\n# Wait for the threads to finish\nthread1.join()\nthread2.join()\n```\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: A sequence diagram is the most appropriate for explaining how a mutex works in Python because it involves interactions between different threads and the mutex over time. The sequence diagram can effectively illustrate the order of operations, such as acquiring and releasing the mutex, and how threads interact with the mutex to access a shared resource. This temporal aspect of the operations makes the sequence diagram a better fit than other diagram types for this explanation.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

It also includes logic to delete expired messages.\n\nTo organize this code effectively within your Django project, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Signal Handler File (`signals.py`):**\n   - Create a new Python file named `signals.py` within your Django app (where your models are located).\n   - Move the signal handling code (including the `@receiver` decorator and the `track_product_changes` function) to this file.\n\n2. **Model File (`models.py`):**\n   - Ensure that the `Product`, `Message`, and `UserProfile` models are defined in the `models.py` file of your Django app.\n   - Make sure to import the necessary modules in the `models.py` file, such as `from django.db import models`.\n\n3. **Management Command for Deleting Expired Messages:**\n   - Follow the previous instructions to create a management command file for deleting expired messages.\n   - You can place this management command file in the same directory as the `signals.py` file.\n\n4. **App Configuration:**\n   - Make sure to include the `signals.py` file in the `__init__.py` file of your app to ensure the signal handlers are registered when the app is loaded.\n\nBy organizing your code in this way, you separate the signal handling logic into its own file (`signals.py`) and keep the model definitions and other related code in the `models.py` file. Additionally, the management command for deleting expired messages can be placed in a separate file for better organization.\n\nRemember to run the management command periodically to delete expired messages as scheduled.",

It also includes logic to delete expired messages.\n\nTo organize this code effectively within your Django project, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Signal Handler File (`signals.py`):**\n   - Create a new Python file named `signals.py` within your Django app (where your models are located).\n   - Move the signal handling code (including the `@receiver` decorator and the `track_product_changes` function) to this file.\n\n2. **Model File (`models.py`):**\n   - Ensure that the `Product`, `Message`, and `UserProfile` models are defined in the `models.py` file of your Django app.\n   - Make sure to import the necessary modules in the `models.py` file, such as `from django.db import models`.\n\n3. **Management Command for Deleting Expired Messages:**\n   - Follow the previous instructions to create a management command file for deleting expired messages.\n   - You can place this management command file in the same directory as the `signals.py` file.\n\n4. **App Configuration:**\n   - Make sure to include the `signals.py` file in the `__init__.py` file of your app to ensure the signal handlers are registered when the app is loaded.\n\nBy organizing your code in this way, you separate the signal handling logic into its own file (`signals.py`) and keep the model definitions and other related code in the `models.py` file. Additionally, the management command for deleting expired messages can be placed in a separate file for better organization.\n\nRemember to run the management command periodically to delete expired messages as scheduled.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The provided code snippet and explanation detail a sequence of operations that occur when a Product model is saved, including checking for changes, creating a message if there are changes, and deleting expired messages. A sequence diagram is best suited to represent the order of these operations and how they interact with different components (models and signal handlers) within the Django application.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

Use the charts below to see the calories from the most popular pizza delivery chains and frozen pizza brands.      You can cut the calories in a slice of pizza by over 20% if you chose thin crust instead of regular crust pizza. But be careful of the toppings you choose. Loading up your pizza can increase the calorie count by over 75%. You\u2019ll find a huge range of calories in pizza from vary delivery chains. The calories depend not only on the chain, but also on the toppings and style.  An average slice of thin crust cheese pizza is about 217 calories, while an average slice of regular cheese pizza is about 278 calories \u2014 that\u2019s 28 percent more calories. So thin crust is usually your best bet if you are counting calories."

You can check the chart below to find the calorie count. But just like pre-packaged frozen pizzas, these prepared foods should have Nutrition Facts labels on the packaging. So read the labels to find out the calories and other nutrition information for the specific products you are buying.

Dominos charges a flat rate for each additional topping regardless of what the topping is. On a standard XL Robust Inspired Tomato Sauce Pizza the first topping costs $5.74. The second topping costs $2.05, the third topping costs $1.85, and subsequent toppings cost $1.95 each thereafter. In contrast, according to our calculations, if you were to purchase the toppings yourself, then on average, each one would cost you $1.61. That comes out to an average mark-up of ~260% for the first topping, 27% for the second topping, 15% for the third topping and 21% for all subsequent toppings. While Dominos charges a flat rate for each topping, in reality there is wide variation among the various toppings and according to our calculations, there are certain toppings that are cheaper to purchase from Dominos rather than the grocery store, leading to a negative mark-up. For example, the amount of beef that you get on an XL Dominos pizza would cost you $4.47 at the local grocery store, but could cost you as little as $1.85 on your Dominos pizza.

        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\nCreate program for pizza with toppings $1 each and flavors $13 each and when it tap all the items it will automatic calculate total price\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\nTo create a program in Java that calculates the total price of a pizza with toppings at $1 each and flavors at $13 each, you can follow the example below. This program allows the user to select toppings and flavors for their pizza and then calculates the total price based on the selections made.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class PizzaOrder {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int totalToppingsPrice = 0;\n        int totalFlavorsPrice = 0;\n\n        System.out.println(\"Welcome to the Pizza Order System!\");\n        System.out.println(\"Toppings cost $1 each and flavors cost $13 each.\");\n\n        // Select Toppings\n        System.out.print(\"How many toppings would you like to add? \");\n        int numToppings = scanner.nextInt();\n        totalToppingsPrice = numToppings;\n\n        // Select Flavors\n        System.out.print(\"How many flavors would you like to add? \");\n        int numFlavors = scanner.nextInt();\n        totalFlavorsPrice = numFlavors * 13;\n\n        // Calculate Total Price\n        int totalPrice = totalToppingsPrice + totalFlavorsPrice;\n\n        System.out.println(\"Total Price for your Pizza: $\" + totalPrice);\n\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this program:\n- The user is prompted to enter the number of toppings and flavors they would like to add to their pizza.\n- The program calculates the total price based on the number of toppings and flavors selected.\n- The total price is then displayed to the user.\n\nYou can run this program by saving it in a file named `PizzaOrder.java`, compiling it, and then executing it using a Java compiler.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The process described involves a sequence of interactions between the user and the system, starting with the user input for toppings and flavors, followed by calculations within the system, and ending with displaying the total price to the user. A sequence diagram is ideal for illustrating these interactions and the order in which they occur.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\nWhat do you mean by Make sure the Discord.js library is correctly imported at the beginning of your code.\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\n### Meaning of \"Make Sure the Discord.js Library is Correctly Imported at the Beginning of Your Code\":\n\n- **Importing the Library**:\n  - When working with Discord.js in a Node.js application, you need to import the Discord.js library at the beginning of your code to access its functionality.\n  - This import statement allows you to use classes, methods, and properties provided by the Discord.js library in your application.\n\n- **Import Statement Example**:\n  - In Node.js, you typically import the Discord.js library using the `require` or `import` statement at the beginning of your code.\n  \n- **Example Import Statement**:\n  ```javascript\n  const { Client } = require('discord.js');\n  ```\n  \n- **Ensure Correctness**:\n  - To ensure that the Discord.js library is correctly imported, make sure the import statement is error-free and points to the correct library name.\n  \n- **Usage**:\n  - Once imported correctly, you can create an instance of the `Client` class provided by Discord.js to interact with the Discord API and build your bot.\n\nBy importing the Discord.js library at the beginning of your code, you enable access to the Discord.js functionality throughout your Node.js application.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation provided outlines a sequence of steps and interactions between the user's code and the Discord.js library, starting from importing the library to using its functionality to interact with the Discord API. A sequence diagram is suitable for illustrating these interactions and the order in which they occur, highlighting the process of importing and utilizing the library in a Node.js application.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

Here is a breakdown of the calculation based on the input values:\n\n- Hours Worked: 50\n- Rate per Hour: $40\n- Category: The category is not explicitly mentioned in the query, but for this calculation, let's assume the category is 'S/ME'.\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n1. **Calculate Gross Pay:**\n   - Gross Pay = Hours Worked * Rate per Hour\n   - Gross Pay = 50 * $40 = $2000\n\n2. **Determine Tax Rate:**\n   - Since the category is 'S/ME', the tax rate is 0.20 (20%)\n\n3. **Calculate Tax Withheld:**\n   - Tax Withheld = Gross Pay * Tax Rate\n   - Tax Withheld = $2000 * 0.20 = $400\n\n4. **Calculate Take Home Pay:**\n   - Take Home Pay = Gross Pay - Tax Withheld\n   - Take Home Pay = $2000 - $400 = $1600\n\n### Expected Results:\n- Tax Withheld: $400\n- Take Home Pay: $1600\n\nTherefore, based on the input values provided (Hours Worked: 50, Rate per Hour: $40, Category: 'S/ME'), the expected tax withheld amount is $400, and the expected take-home pay is $1600.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The provided code and explanation detail a sequence of operations that occur from the moment a user interacts with a web page (clicking a button) to the calculation of tax withheld and take-home pay, and finally displaying the results. A sequence diagram is most appropriate here because it can effectively illustrate the order of these operations and the interaction between different functions (getValues, getTaxWithheld, showResults) and user actions (click events).\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

        "question": "on the page \"proshli.html \" you can use JavaScript to extract form data from URL parameters and display it on the page. how to do it",
        "answer": "To extract form data from URL parameters and display it on the \"proshli.html\" page using JavaScript, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Parse the URL parameters to extract the form data.\n2. Display the extracted form data on the \"proshli.html\" page.\n\nHere is a sample JavaScript code snippet that you can use on the \"proshli.html\" page to achieve this:\n\n```javascript\n// Parse the URL parameters\nconst urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);\n\n// Get the form data from the URL parameters\nconst username = urlParams.get('username');\nconst password = urlParams.get('password');\nconst email = urlParams.get('email');\nconst option = urlParams.get('option');\nconst enrollmentYear = urlParams.get('enrollmentYear');\nconst studyDirection = urlParams.get('studyDirection');\nconst feedback = urlParams.get('feedback');\n\n// Display the form data on the page\ndocument.getElementById('username').innerText = username;\ndocument.getElementById('password').innerText = password;\ndocument.getElementById('email').innerText = email;\ndocument.getElementById('option').innerText = option;\ndocument.getElementById('enrollmentYear').innerText = enrollmentYear;\ndocument.getElementById('studyDirection').innerText = studyDirection;\ndocument.getElementById('feedback').innerText = feedback;\n```\n\nIn your \"proshli.html\" page, you should have placeholders (like `<span>` elements with specific IDs) where you want to display the form data. For example:\n\n```html\n<p>Username: <span id=\"username\"></span></p>\n<p>Password: <span id=\"password\"></span></p>\n<p>Email: <span id=\"email\"></span></p>\n<p>Are you a mathematician: <span id=\"option\"></span></p>\n<p>Enrollment Year: <span id=\"enrollmentYear\"></span></p>\n<p>Study Direction: <span id=\"studyDirection\"></span></p>\n<p>Feedback: <span id=\"feedback\"></span></p>\n```\n\nBy using the JavaScript code above and including placeholders for the form data on the \"proshli.html\" page, you can extract the form data from the URL parameters and display it dynamically on the page.",

Feel free to change this depending on your use case: var paramValue = typeof (a) === 'undefined' ? true : a; Optionally, you can set all parameter names and values to lowercase.

You'll be provided the \"Question\", the \"Answer\", the \"DiagramType\" and the \"DiagramTypeDocs\"\nYour output will be parsed and validate so you must reply with VALID mermaidJS code only and in the following format:\n```mermaid\n{ diagram }\n```\n\nPrefer diagrams with simple syntax\nAvoid styling on the diagram\nEscape characters when needed\nMake sure that you don't use any forbidden mermaid characters\nMake sure to below the instructions and examples in the syntax documentation\nYou MUST produce valid mermaidJS syntax!\n",
        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\non the page \"proshli.html \" you can use JavaScript to extract form data from URL parameters and display it on the page. how to do it\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\nTo extract form data from URL parameters and display it on the \"proshli.html\" page using JavaScript, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Parse the URL parameters to extract the form data.\n2. Display the extracted form data on the \"proshli.html\" page.\n\nHere is a sample JavaScript code snippet that you can use on the \"proshli.html\" page to achieve this:\n\n```javascript\n// Parse the URL parameters\nconst urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);\n\n// Get the form data from the URL parameters\nconst username = urlParams.get('username');\nconst password = urlParams.get('password');\nconst email = urlParams.get('email');\nconst option = urlParams.get('option');\nconst enrollmentYear = urlParams.get('enrollmentYear');\nconst studyDirection = urlParams.get('studyDirection');\nconst feedback = urlParams.get('feedback');\n\n// Display the form data on the page\ndocument.getElementById('username').innerText = username;\ndocument.getElementById('password').innerText = password;\ndocument.getElementById('email').innerText = email;\ndocument.getElementById('option').innerText = option;\ndocument.getElementById('enrollmentYear').innerText = enrollmentYear;\ndocument.getElementById('studyDirection').innerText = studyDirection;\ndocument.getElementById('feedback').innerText = feedback;\n```\n\nIn your \"proshli.html\" page, you should have placeholders (like `<span>` elements with specific IDs) where you want to display the form data. For example:\n\n```html\n<p>Username: <span id=\"username\"></span></p>\n<p>Password: <span id=\"password\"></span></p>\n<p>Email: <span id=\"email\"></span></p>\n<p>Are you a mathematician: <span id=\"option\"></span></p>\n<p>Enrollment Year: <span id=\"enrollmentYear\"></span></p>\n<p>Study Direction: <span id=\"studyDirection\"></span></p>\n<p>Feedback: <span id=\"feedback\"></span></p>\n```\n\nBy using the JavaScript code above and including placeholders for the form data on the \"proshli.html\" page, you can extract the form data from the URL parameters and display it dynamically on the page.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The process described involves a sequence of steps to extract form data from URL parameters and display it on a web page. A sequence diagram is suitable for illustrating how these operations interact over time, starting from parsing the URL parameters to displaying the data on the page. It effectively shows the order of operations and the flow of data, which aligns with the nature of a sequence diagram.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

For example, in Devanagari, a writing system used in India and Nepal, vowel sounds are written as marks modifying the consonant glyph.

Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The given answer describes a sequence of operations performed on a string, starting from assigning a phrase to a variable and ending with replacing a word within the phrase. A sequence diagram is suitable for illustrating the order in which these operations occur, showing the interaction between the programmer and the string object through method calls.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

        "question": "Can you provide examples of how subtitles can be added to videos in a Next.js application?",
        "answer": "To add subtitles to videos in a Next.js application, you can use the `<track>` element inside the `<video>` tag. Here is an example of how you can add subtitles to a video in a Next.js application:\n\n```jsx\n// Import the necessary functions and components\nimport { list } from '@vercel/blob';\n\n// Define the VideoComponent function\nasync function VideoComponent({ fileName }) {\n    // Fetch the video and subtitles URLs from Vercel Blob\n    const { blobs } = await list({\n        prefix: fileName,\n        limit: 2\n    });\n    const { url } = blobs[0];\n    const { url: captionsUrl } = blobs[1];\n\n    // Return the video element with subtitles\n    return (\n        <video controls preload=\"none\" aria-label=\"Video player\">\n            <source src={url} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n            <track\n                src={captionsUrl}\n                kind=\"subtitles\"\n                srclang=\"en\"\n                label=\"English\"\n            />\n            Your browser does not support the video tag.\n        </video>\n    );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The `VideoComponent` function fetches the video and subtitles URLs from Vercel Blob using the `list` function.\n- The `<video>` element is rendered with the video source and a `<track>` element for subtitles.\n- The subtitles are specified with the `kind=\"subtitles\"`, `srclang=\"en\"` (language), and `label=\"English\"` attributes.\n\nYou can use this approach to effectively add subtitles to videos in your Next.js application.",

how to use videos with Next.js applications, showing how to store and display video files without affecting performance.\n\n\n[Using `<video>` and `<iframe>`](#using-video-and-iframe)\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nVideos can be embedded on the page using the HTML **`<video>`** tag for direct video files and **`<iframe>`** for external platform-hosted videos.\n\n\n### [`<video>`](#video)\n\n\nThe HTML [`<video>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) tag can embed self-hosted or directly served video content, allowing full control over the playback and appearance.\n\n\napp/ui/video.jsx\n```\nexport function Video() {\n return (\n <video width=\"320\" height=\"240\" controls preload=\"none\">\n <source src=\"/path/to/video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n <track\n src=\"/path/to/captions.vtt\"\n kind=\"subtitles\"\n srclang=\"en\"\n label=\"English\"\n />\n Your browser does not support the video tag.\n </video>\n )\n}\n```\n\n### [Common `<video>` tag attributes](#common-video-tag-attributes)\n\n\n\n\n| Attribute | Description | Example Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `src` | Specifies the source of the video file. | `<video src=\"/path/to/video.mp4\" />` |\n| `width` | Sets the width of the video player. | `<video width=\"320\" />` |\n| `height` | Sets the height of the video player. | `<video height=\"240\" />` |\n| `controls` | If present, it displays the default set of playback controls. | `<video controls />` |\n| `autoplay` | Automatically starts playing the video when the page loads. Note: Autoplay policies vary across browsers. | `<video autoplay />` |\n| `loop` | Loops the video playback. | `<video loop />` |\n| `muted` | Mutes the audio by default. Often used with `autoplay`. | `<video muted />` |\n| `preload` | Specifies how the video is preloaded. Values: `none`, `metadata`, `auto`. | `<video preload=\"none\" />` |\n| `playsInline` | Enables inline playback on iOS devices, often necessary for autoplay to work on iOS Safari. | `<video playsInline />` |\n\n\n\n> \n> **Good to know**: When using the `autoplay` attribute, it is important to also include the `muted` attribute to ensure the video plays automatically in most browsers and the `playsInline` attribute for compatibility with iOS devices.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nFor a comprehensive list of video attributes, refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#attributes).\n\n\n### [Video best practices](#video-best-practices)\n\n\n* **Fallback Content:** When using the `<video>` tag, include fallback content inside the tag for browsers that do not support video playback.\n* **Subtitles or Captions:** Include subtitles or captions for users who are deaf or hard of hearing. Utilize the [`<track>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/track) tag with your `<video>` elements to specify caption file sources.\n* **Accessible Controls:** Standard HTML5 video controls are recommended for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility. For advanced needs, consider third-party players like [react-player](https://github.com/cookpete/react-player) or [video.js](https://videojs.com/), which offer accessible controls and consistent browser experience.\n\n\n### [`<iframe>`](#iframe)\n\n\nThe HTML `<iframe>` tag allows you to embed videos from external platforms like YouTube or Vimeo.\n\n\napp/page.jsx\n```\nexport default function Page() {\n return (\n <iframe\n src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfU1iZnjRZM\"\n frameborder=\"0\"\n allowfullscreen\n />\n )\n}\n```\n\n### [Common `<iframe>` tag attributes](#common-iframe-tag-attributes)\n\n\n\n\n| Attribute | Description | Example Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `src` | The URL of the page to embed. | `<iframe src=\"https://example.com\" />` |\n| `width` | Sets the width of the iframe. | `<iframe width=\"500\" />` |\n| `height` | Sets the height of the iframe. | `<iframe height=\"300\" />` |\n| `frameborder` | Specifies whether or not to display a border around the iframe. | `<iframe frameborder=\"0\" />` |\n| `allowfullscreen` | Allows the iframe content to be displayed in full-screen mode. | `<iframe allowfullscreen />` |\n| `sandbox` | Enables an extra set of restrictions on the content within the iframe. | `<iframe sandbox />` |\n| `loading` | Optimize loading behavior (e.g., lazy loading). | `<iframe loading=\"lazy\" />` |\n| `title` | Provides a title for the iframe to support accessibility. | `<iframe title=\"Description\" />` |\n\n\nFor a comprehensive list of iframe attributes, refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attributes).\n\n\n### [Choosing a video embedding method](#choosing-a-video-embedding-method)\n\n\nThere are two ways you can embed videos in your Next.js application:\n\n\n* **Self-hosted or direct video files:** Embed self-hosted videos using the `<video>` tag for scenarios requiring detailed control over the player's functionality and appearance. This integration method within Next.js allows for customization and control of your video content.\n* **Using video hosting services (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.):** For video hosting services like YouTube or Vimeo, you'll embed their iframe-based players using the `<iframe>` tag. While this method limits some control over the player, it offers ease of use and features provided by these platforms.\n\n\nChoose the embedding method that aligns with your application's requirements and the user experience you aim to deliver.\n\n\n### [Embedding externally hosted videos](#embedding-externally-hosted-videos)\n\n\nTo embed videos from external platforms, you can use Next.js to fetch the video information and React Suspense to handle the fallback state while loading.\n\n\n**1. Create a Server Component for video embedding**\n\n\nThe first step is to create a [Server Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) that generates the appropriate iframe for embedding the video. This component will fetch the source URL for the video and render the iframe.\n\n\napp/ui/video-component.jsx\n```\nexport const async function VideoComponent (){\n const src = await getVideoSrc()\n \n return <iframe src={src} frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen />\n}\n```\n\n**2. Stream the video component using React Suspense**\n\n\nAfter creating the Server Component to embed the video, the next step is to [stream](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) the component using [React Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense).\n\n\napp/page.jsx\n```\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport VideoComponent from '../ui/VideoComponent.jsx'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n return (\n <section>\n <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading video...</p>}>\n <VideoComponent />\n </Suspense>\n {/\\* Other content of the page \\*/}\n </section>\n )\n}\n```\n\n\n> \n> **Good to know**: When embedding videos from external platforms, consider the following best practices:\n> \n> \n> * Ensure the video embeds are responsive. Use CSS to make the iframe or video player adapt to different screen sizes.\n> * Implement [strategies for loading videos](https://yoast.com/site-speed-tips-for-faster-video/) based on network conditions, especially for users with limited data plans.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThis approach results in a better user experience as it prevents the page from blocking, meaning the user can interact with the page while the video component streams in.\n\n\nFor a more engaging and informative loading experience, consider using a loading skeleton as the fallback UI. So instead of showing a simple loading message, you can show a skeleton that resembles the video player like this:\n\n\napp/page.jsx\n```\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport VideoComponent from '../ui/VideoComponent.jsx'\nimport VideoSkeleton from '../ui/VideoSkeleton.jsx'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n return (\n <section>\n <Suspense fallback={<VideoSkeleton />}>\n <VideoComponent />\n </Suspense>\n {/\\* Other content of the page \\*/}\n </section>\n )\n}\n```\n\n[Self-hosted videos](#self-hosted-videos)\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nSelf-hosting videos may be preferable for several reasons:\n\n\n* **Complete control and independence**: Self-hosting gives you direct management over your video content, from playback to appearance, ensuring full ownership and control, free from external platform constraints.\n* **Customization for specific needs**: Ideal for unique requirements, like dynamic background videos, it allows for tailored customization to align with design and functional needs.\n* **Performance and scalability considerations**: Choose storage solutions that are both high-performing and scalable, to support increasing traffic and content size effectively.\n* **Cost and integration**: Balance the costs of storage and bandwidth with the need for easy integration into your Next.js framework and broader tech ecosystem.\n\n\n### [Using Vercel Blob for video hosting](#using-vercel-blob-for-video-hosting)\n\n\n[Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob) offers an efficient way to host videos, providing a scalable cloud storage solution that works well with Next.js. Here's how you can host a video using Vercel Blob:\n\n\n**1. Uploading a video to Vercel Blob**\n\n\nIn your Vercel dashboard, navigate to the \"Storage\" tab and select your Vercel Blob database. In the Blob table's upper-right corner, find and click the \"Upload\" button. Then, choose the video file you wish to upload. After the upload completes, the video file will appear in the Blob table.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can upload your video using a server action. For detailed instructions, refer to the Vercel documentation on [server-side uploads](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/server-upload). Vercel also supports [client-side uploads](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/client-upload). This method may be preferable for certain use cases.\n\n\n**2. Displaying the video in Next.js**\n\n\nOnce the video is uploaded and stored, you can display it in your Next.js application. Here's an example of how to do this using the `<video>` tag and React Suspense:\n\n\napp/page.jsx\n```\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport { list } from '@vercel/blob'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n return (\n <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading video...</p>}>\n <VideoComponent fileName=\"my-video.mp4\" />\n </Suspense>\n )\n}\n \nasync function VideoComponent({ fileName }) {\n const { blobs } = await list({\n prefix: fileName,\n limit: 1,\n })\n const { url } = blobs[0]\n \n return (\n <video controls preload=\"none\" aria-label=\"Video player\">\n <source src={url} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n Your browser does not support the video tag.\n </video>\n )\n}\n```\n\nIn this approach, the page uses the video's `@vercel/blob` URL to display the video using the `VideoComponent`. React Suspense is used to show a fallback until the video URL is fetched and the video is ready to be displayed.\n\n\n### [Adding subtitles to your video](#adding-subtitles-to-your-video)\n\n\nIf you have subtitles for your video, you can easily add them using the `<track>` element inside your `<video>` tag. You can fetch the subtitle file from Vercel Blob in a similar way as the video file. Here's how you can update the `<VideoComponent>` to include subtitles.\n\n\napp/page.jsx\n```\nasync function VideoComponent({ fileName }) {\n const {blobs} = await list({\n prefix: fileName,\n limit: 2\n });\n const { url } = blobs[0];\n const { url: captionsUrl } = blobs[1];\n \n return (\n <video controls preload=\"none\" aria-label=\"Video player\">\n <source src={url} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n <track\n src={captionsUrl}\n kind=\"subtitles\"\n srclang=\"en\"\n label=\"English\">\n Your browser does not support the video tag.\n </video>\n );\n};\n```\n\nBy following this approach, you can effectively self-host and integrate videos into your Next.js applications.\n\n\n[Resources](#resources)\n-----------------------\n\n\nTo continue learning more about video optimization and best practices, please refer to the following resources:\n\n\n* **Understanding video formats and codecs**: Choose the right format and codec, like MP4 for compatibility or WebM for web optimization, for your video needs. For more details, see [Mozilla's guide on video codecs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Video_codecs).\n* **Video compression**: Use tools like FFmpeg to effectively compress videos, balancing quality with file size. Learn about compression techniques at [FFmpeg's official website](https://www.ffmpeg.org/).\n* **Resolution and bitrate adjustment**: Adjust [resolution and bitrate](https://www.dacast.com/blog/bitrate-vs-resolution/#:~:text=The%20two%20measure%20different%20aspects,yield%20different%20qualities%20of%20video) based on the viewing platform, with lower settings for mobile devices.\n* **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Utilize a CDN to enhance video delivery speed and manage high traffic. When using some storage solutions, such as Vercel Blob, CDN functionality is automatically handled for you. [Learn more](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) about CDNs and their benefits.\n\n\nExplore these video streaming platforms for integrating video into your Next.js projects:\n\n\n### [Open source `next-video` component](#open-source-next-video-component)\n\n\n* Provides a `<Video>` component for Next.js, compatible with various hosting services including Vercel Blob, S3, Backblaze, and Mux.\n* [Detailed documentation](https://next-video.dev/docs) for using `next-video.dev` with different hosting services.\n\n\n### [Cloudinary Integration](#cloudinary-integration)\n\n\n* Official [documentation and integration guides](https://support.cloudinary.com/hc/en-us/categories/200477762-Client-Libraries-and-Integration-Guides) for using Cloudinary with Next.js.\n* A [specific guide](https://next.cloudinary.dev/nextjs-13) on integrating Cloudinary with Next.js.\n\n\n### [Mux Video API](#mux-video-api)\n\n\n* Mux provides a [starter template](https://github.com/muxinc/video-course-starter-kit) for creating a video course with Mux and Next.js.\n* Learn about Mux's recommendations for embedding [high-performance video for your Next.js application](https://www.mux.com/for/nextjs).\n* Explore an [example project](https://with-mux-video.vercel.app/) demonstrating Mux with Next.js.\n\n\n### [Fastly](#fastly)\n\n\n* Learn more about integrating Fastly's solutions for [video on demand](https://www.fastly.com/products/streaming-media/video-on-demand) and streaming media into Next.js.\n[PreviousImages](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images)[NextFonts](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)Was this helpful?\n\n\n\n\nsupported.Send[![GitHub Logo](/icons/github.svg)](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)\n\n---\n\n[![X Logo](/icons/x.svg)](https://twitter.com/nextjs)#### Resources\n\n[Docs](/docs)[Learn](/learn)[Showcase](/showcase)[Blog](/blog)[Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=docs_app_building-your-application_optimizing_videos)[Next.js Conf](/conf)[DX Platform](https://vercel.com/products/dx-platform?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=docs_app_building-your-application_optimizing_videos)#### More\n\n[Next.js Commerce](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-commerce?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=docs_app_building-your-application_optimizing_videos)[Contact Sales](https://vercel.com/contact/sales?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=docs_app_building-your-application_optimizing_videos)[GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)[Releases](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases)[Telemetry](/telemetry)[Governance](/governance)#### About Vercel\n\n[Next.js + Vercel](https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=docs_app_building-your-application_optimizing_videos)[Open Source Software](https://vercel.com/oss?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=docs_app_building-your-application_optimizing_videos)[GitHub](https://github.com/vercel)[X](https://twitter.com/vercel)#### Legal\n\n[Privacy Policy](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy)Cookie Preferences#### Subscribe to our newsletter\n\nStay updated on new releases and features, guides, and case studies.\n\nSubscribe\u00a9 2024 Vercel, Inc.\n\n[![GitHub Logo](/icons/github.svg)](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)\n\n---\n\n[![X Logo](/icons/x.svg)](https://twitter.com/nextjs)",

        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\nCan you provide examples of how subtitles can be added to videos in a Next.js application?\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\nTo add subtitles to videos in a Next.js application, you can use the `<track>` element inside the `<video>` tag. Here is an example of how you can add subtitles to a video in a Next.js application:\n\n```jsx\n// Import the necessary functions and components\nimport { list } from '@vercel/blob';\n\n// Define the VideoComponent function\nasync function VideoComponent({ fileName }) {\n    // Fetch the video and subtitles URLs from Vercel Blob\n    const { blobs } = await list({\n        prefix: fileName,\n        limit: 2\n    });\n    const { url } = blobs[0];\n    const { url: captionsUrl } = blobs[1];\n\n    // Return the video element with subtitles\n    return (\n        <video controls preload=\"none\" aria-label=\"Video player\">\n            <source src={url} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n            <track\n                src={captionsUrl}\n                kind=\"subtitles\"\n                srclang=\"en\"\n                label=\"English\"\n            />\n            Your browser does not support the video tag.\n        </video>\n    );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The `VideoComponent` function fetches the video and subtitles URLs from Vercel Blob using the `list` function.\n- The `<video>` element is rendered with the video source and a `<track>` element for subtitles.\n- The subtitles are specified with the `kind=\"subtitles\"`, `srclang=\"en\"` (language), and `label=\"English\"` attributes.\n\nYou can use this approach to effectively add subtitles to videos in your Next.js application.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation provided outlines a sequence of operations starting from fetching video and subtitle URLs, to rendering them within a video component in a Next.js application. A sequence diagram is ideal for illustrating the order of operations and the interaction between different components (e.g., the VideoComponent function and the Vercel Blob service) in this process.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

You will then be given an unknown number of names to query your phone book for. For each  queried, print the associated entry from your phone book on a new line in the form name=phoneNumber; if an entry for  is not found, print Not found instead.\n\nNote: Your phone book should be a Dictionary/Map/HashMap data structure.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of entries in the phone book.\nEach of the  subsequent lines describes an entry in the form of  space-separated values on a single line. The first value is a friend's name, and the second value is an -digit phone number.\n\nAfter the  lines of phone book entries, there are an unknown number of lines of queries. Each line (query) contains a  to look up, and you must continue reading lines until there is no more input.\n\nNote: Names consist of lowercase English alphabetic letters and are first names only.\n\nConstraints\n\nOutput Format\n\nOn a new line for each query, print Not found if the name has no corresponding entry in the phone book; otherwise, print the full  and  in the format name=phoneNumber.\n\nSample Input\n\n3\nsam 99912222\ntom 11122222\nharry 12299933\nsam\nedward\nharry\nSample Output\n\nsam=99912222\nNot found\nharry=12299933\nExplanation\n\nWe add the following  (Key,Value) pairs to our map so it looks like this:\n\n\nWe then process each query and print key=value if the queried  is found in the map; otherwise, we print Not found.\n\nQuery 0: sam\nSam is one of the keys in our dictionary, so we print sam=99912222.\n\nQuery 1: edward\nEdward is not one of the keys in our dictionary, so we print Not found.\n\nQuery 2: harry\nHarry is one of the keys in our dictionary, so we print harry=12299933.",

Each line (query) contains a  to look up, and you must continue reading lines until there is no more input.\n\nNote: Names consist of lowercase English alphabetic letters and are first names only.\n\nConstraints\n\nOutput Format\n\nOn a new line for each query, print Not found if the name has no corresponding entry in the phone book; otherwise, print the full  and  in the format name=phoneNumber.\n\nSample Input\n\n3\nsam 99912222\ntom 11122222\nharry 12299933\nsam\nedward\nharry\nSample Output\n\nsam=99912222\nNot found\nharry=12299933\nExplanation\n\nWe add the following  (Key,Value) pairs to our map so it looks like this:\n\n\nWe then process each query and print key=value if the queried  is found in the map; otherwise, we print Not found.\n\nQuery 0: sam\nSam is one of the keys in our dictionary, so we print sam=99912222.\n\nQuery 1: edward\nEdward is not one of the keys in our dictionary, so we print Not found.\n\nQuery 2: harry\nHarry is one of the keys in our dictionary, so we print harry=12299933.\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\nAnswer generation was manually stopped.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The task involves a sequence of operations starting with creating a phone book, followed by querying this phone book for specific names. A sequence diagram is suitable for illustrating the order of these operations, including the decision-making process involved in checking if a name exists in the phone book and then either retrieving the phone number or indicating that the entry is not found. This process is inherently sequential and involves interactions between the user, the phone book data structure, and the output, making a sequence diagram the most appropriate choice.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

        "answer": "To bind the value of `selectedType` to the code block you provided, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Ensure that the `selectedType` variable is accessible in the scope where the code block is located.\n2. Update the code block to include a check for `selectedType` before executing the logic inside the `if (ActiveTabIndex == 0)` block.\n\nHere's how you can modify the code block to bind the value of `selectedType`:\n\n```csharp\nif (ActiveTabIndex == 0)\n{\n    responsiblityCenter = await _responsibilityService.GetResponView();\n    user = await _userService.All(\"\",\"\");\n    \n    if (voucherId > 0)\n    {\n        // Other existing logic\n        \n        // Add the following code to bind the value of selectedType\n        if (selectedType == \"Internal\")\n        {\n            user = await _userService.All(\"\", \"\");\n            selectedTypeVariable = selectedType;\n            selectedPayeeLabel = SelectedUser?.FullName;\n        }\n        else if (selectedType == \"Person\")\n        {\n            payeeName = payee.FirstOrDefault(a => a.PayeeId == PayeeId);\n            selectedTypeVariable = selectedType;\n            selectedPayeeLabel = payeeName?.FullName;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            SelectedCom = CompanyView.FirstOrDefault(a => a.PayeeId == PayeeId);\n            selectedTypeVariable = selectedType;\n            selectedPayeeLabel = SelectedCom?.CompanyName;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy adding this conditional logic within the `if (ActiveTabIndex == 0)` block, you can bind the value of `selectedType` to the appropriate variables based on the selected type (Person, Internal, or other).",

If you give Codex a longer prompt including the above example, then its completion names the arguments exactly as with the example you gave.

LLMs like GPT-3 and Codex have continued to push the bounds of what AI is capable of - they can capably generate language and code, but are also capable of emergent behavior like question answering, summarization, classification and dialog. One of the best techniques for enabling specific behavior out of LLMs is called prompt engineering - crafting inputs that coax the model to produce certain kinds of outputs. Few-shot prompting is the discipline of giving examples of inputs and outputs, such that the model has a reference for the type of output you're looking for. Prompt engineering can be as simple as formatting a question and passing it to the model, but it can also get quite complex - requiring substantial code to manipulate and update strings. This library aims to make that easier. It also aims to codify patterns and practices around prompt engineering. See How to get Codex to produce the code you want article for an example of the prompt engineering patterns this library codifies. The library currently supports a generic PromptEngine, a CodeEngine and a ChatEngine. All three facilitate a pattern of prompt engineering where the prompt is composed of a description, examples of inputs and outputs and an ongoing \"dialog\" representing the ongoing input/output pairs as the user and model communicate."

Ensure that the `selectedType` variable is accessible in the scope where the code block is located.\n2. Update the code block to include a check for `selectedType` before executing the logic inside the `if (ActiveTabIndex == 0)` block.\n\nHere's how you can modify the code block to bind the value of `selectedType`:\n\n```csharp\nif (ActiveTabIndex == 0)\n{\n    responsiblityCenter = await _responsibilityService.GetResponView();\n    user = await _userService.All(\"\",\"\");\n    \n    if (voucherId > 0)\n    {\n        // Other existing logic\n        \n        // Add the following code to bind the value of selectedType\n        if (selectedType == \"Internal\")\n        {\n            user = await _userService.All(\"\", \"\");\n            selectedTypeVariable = selectedType;\n            selectedPayeeLabel = SelectedUser?.FullName;\n        }\n        else if (selectedType == \"Person\")\n        {\n            payeeName = payee.FirstOrDefault(a => a.PayeeId == PayeeId);\n            selectedTypeVariable = selectedType;\n            selectedPayeeLabel = payeeName?.FullName;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            SelectedCom = CompanyView.FirstOrDefault(a => a.PayeeId == PayeeId);\n            selectedTypeVariable = selectedType;\n            selectedPayeeLabel = SelectedCom?.CompanyName;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy adding this conditional logic within the `if (ActiveTabIndex == 0)` block, you can bind the value of `selectedType` to the appropriate variables based on the selected type (Person, Internal, or other).\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The provided scenario involves a sequence of operations that depend on the value of 'selectedType' and the active tab index. It describes how different parts of the system interact based on these conditions, making a sequence diagram the most appropriate choice. This diagram type can effectively illustrate the order of operations and the conditional interactions between different components of the system, such as the user interface elements and service calls, based on the user's selection and other conditions.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\nHow can you validate the same using Firebase Authentication\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\n### Using Firebase Authentication for Validation\n\nTo achieve similar authentication functionality using Firebase Authentication, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Setting up Firebase Authentication:**\n   - Initialize Firebase in your web app and configure Firebase Authentication.\n\n2. **User Login:**\n   - Use Firebase's `signInWithEmailAndPassword` method to authenticate users with their email and password.\n   - Handle the success and error callbacks accordingly.\n\n3. **Token Generation:**\n   - Firebase Authentication automatically generates ID tokens for users upon successful login.\n   - You can access the user's token using `currentUser.getIdToken()`.\n\n4. **Token Verification:**\n   - Firebase handles token verification internally.\n   - You can access the user's basic profile information through `currentUser`.\n\n5. **Logout:**\n   - Use `signOut()` method to log the user out of Firebase Authentication.\n\n6. **Additional Security Features:**\n   - Firebase Authentication provides built-in security features like email verification, phone number authentication, and OAuth provider support.\n\nBy integrating Firebase Authentication into your web app, you can achieve secure user authentication, token management, and user management with ease.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The answer describes a process involving multiple steps and interactions between the user and Firebase Authentication services, such as logging in, token generation, and verification. A sequence diagram is ideal for illustrating these interactions and the order in which they occur, making it easier to understand the flow of operations and how components interact over time.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

        "question": "this two function is my problem",
        "answer": "Based on the provided code snippets, you have two functions, `SwitchTurns` and `Cards_Click`, that you're having issues with. The goal seems to be to switch turns between two players after a single card click or move. Let's address potential issues and solutions for each function:\n\n### `SwitchTurns` Function\n\nThe `SwitchTurns` function toggles the turn between two players and updates the UI to reflect whose turn it is. The function correctly toggles the `isPlayer1Turn` boolean variable and updates the UI elements (`label1` and `label2`) to visually indicate the active player. However, there was a mistake in the font size adjustment in your initial approach, which was corrected in the provided solution. Ensure you have the corrected version:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void SwitchTurns()\n{\n    isPlayer1Turn = !isPlayer1Turn;\n\n    if (isPlayer1Turn)\n    {\n        MessageBox.Show(\"Player 1's Turn\");\n        label1.ForeColor = Color.Black;\n        label2.ForeColor = Color.Red;\n        label1.Font = new Font(label1.Font.FontFamily, normalFontSize, FontStyle.Regular);\n        label2.Font = new Font(label2.Font.FontFamily, turnFontSize, FontStyle.Bold);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        label1.ForeColor = Color.Red;\n        label2.ForeColor = Color.Black;\n        label2.Font = new Font(label2.Font.FontFamily, normalFontSize, FontStyle.Regular);\n        label1.Font = new Font(label1.Font.FontFamily, turnFontSize, FontStyle.Bold);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### `Cards_Click` Function\n\nThe `Cards_Click` function is triggered when a card is clicked. It performs several operations, including setting the clicked card's image, removing the used image from a list, and adding the clicked card to a list of clicked cards. If a condition is met (in your case, checking if all 2-10 cards are clicked, which seems to be mistakenly set to check for just one card), it moves the clicked cards to a discard pile and then switches turns.\n\nTo ensure that turns switch after each card click or move, you should call `SwitchTurns` at the end of the `Cards_Click` function, outside any conditional checks that are not related to the turn switching itself. Here's a simplified example of how to incorporate the turn switch after a card is clicked:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void Cards_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    PictureBox pictureBox = sender as PictureBox;\n    if (pictureBox != null && images.Count > 0)\n    {\n        // Existing logic for handling a card click\n\n        // Always switch turns after handling the card click\n        SwitchTurns();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that regardless of other game logic, the turn will switch after a card is clicked.\n\n### Summary\n\n- Ensure the `SwitchTurns` function uses the corrected approach for font size adjustment.\n- Modify the `Cards_Click` function to call `SwitchTurns` at the end of the function to switch turns after every card click.\n\nThese adjustments should address the problem of switching turns between players after each move.",

Without the secret, you might as well try to brute force the unified theory of science. The thing is solid as a rock! Yet as simple as a cup of coffee on a Sunday morning.  If you copy and paste the above token into the textbox at\u00a0JWT.io, you can clearly see all individual components in your token. It contains an expiration in the form of a Unix timestamp, a name, and some additional data that, combined, allows you to transparently read the token's value in your frontend layer.  In your backend, you can easily validate the token by taking its payload, appending your secret to it, and recreating the same hashing value that is in its signature. If the hash is the same, you know the token is valid. This makes it impossible for anyone not knowing the secret that was used to create the hash signature to create a token that is valid for your backend API."

JWT token is used to identify authorized users.  Open Standard: Means anywhere, anytime, and anyone can use JWT. Secure data transfer between any two bodies, any two users, any two servers. It is digitally signed: Information is verified and trusted. There is no alteration of data. Compact: because JWT can be sent via URL, post request & HTTP header. Fast transmission makes JWT more usable."

If multiple types of entities or other custom data is required to be returned from a controller method then a custom model class should be created in the Models folder for the response. The [JsonIgnore] attribute prevents the password property from being serialized and returned in api responses. The app settings class contains properties defined in the appsettings.json file and is used for accessing application settings via objects that are injected into classes using the .NET built in dependency injection (DI) system. For example the user service accesses app settings via an IOptions<AppSettings> appSettings object that is injected into the constructor. Mapping of configuration sections to classes is done in the Program.cs file. The custom authorize attribute is added to controller action methods that require the user to be authenticated. Authorization is performed by the OnAuthorization method which checks if there is an authenticated user attached to the current request (context.HttpContext.Items[\"User\"]). An authenticated user is attached by the custom jwt middleware if the request contains a valid JWT access token."

                "content": "The user entity class represents the data for a user in the application. Entity classes are used to pass data between different parts of the application (e.g. between services and controllers) and can be used to return http response data from controller action methods. If multiple types of entities or other custom data is required to be returned from a controller method then a custom model class should be created in the Models folder for the response. The [JsonIgnore] attribute prevents the password property from being serialized and returned in api responses. The app settings class contains properties defined in the appsettings.json file and is used for accessing application settings via objects that are injected into classes using the .NET built in dependency injection (DI) system. For example the user service accesses app settings via an IOptions<AppSettings> appSettings object that is injected into the constructor. Mapping of configuration sections to classes is done in the Program.cs file. The custom authorize attribute is added to controller action methods that require the user to be authenticated. Authorization is performed by the OnAuthorization method which checks if there is an authenticated user attached to the current request (context.HttpContext.Items[\"User\"])."

You'll be provided the \"Question\", the \"Answer\", the \"DiagramType\" and the \"DiagramTypeDocs\"\nYour output will be parsed and validate so you must reply with VALID mermaidJS code only and in the following format:\n```mermaid\n{ diagram }\n```\n\nPrefer diagrams with simple syntax\nAvoid styling on the diagram\nEscape characters when needed\nMake sure that you don't use any forbidden mermaid characters\nMake sure to below the instructions and examples in the syntax documentation\nYou MUST produce valid mermaidJS syntax!\n",
        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\nHow do i add jwt auth in .net\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\nTo add JWT authentication in a .NET application, you typically need to follow these steps based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Create Models for Users and Tokens**:\n   - Create two classes named `Users` and `Tokens` in a Models folder.\n   - The `Users` class should have properties for Name and Password.\n   - The `Tokens` class should have properties for Token and RefreshToken.\n\n2. **Create an Interface for JWT Management**:\n   - Create an interface named `IJWTManagerRepository` in a Repository folder.\n   - Add a method `Authenticate(Users u)` in the interface to generate a valid JWT Token.\n\n3. **Implement JWT Authentication**:\n   - Use the `Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` namespaces.\n   - Implement JWT authentication logic in your application.\n   - Generate JWT tokens and handle user authentication using the provided classes and methods.\n\n4. **Secure Your API**:\n   - Add authentication middleware in your application's pipeline.\n   - Use JWT tokens to authenticate and authorize users accessing your API endpoints.\n\nRemember, the exact implementation details may vary based on your specific requirements and the version of .NET you are using. Make sure to adapt the steps to fit your application structure and needs.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The answer outlines a sequence of steps to implement JWT authentication in a .NET application, starting from creating models, defining an interface, implementing authentication logic, and finally securing the API. A sequence diagram is ideal for illustrating how these components interact over time, showing the order of operations and the flow from one step to the next. This diagram type effectively represents the process flow and interactions between different parts of the system during the authentication process.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

A sequence diagram is best suited to represent the sequence of operations, method calls, and the flow of execution between objects (or methods) over time, which aligns well with illustrating how the multithreaded merge sort operates, including the creation of threads and their synchronization points.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

When designing a recursive method keep in mind that you need: Current Java compilers (up to and including Java 9) do not perform tail-call elimination.

You'll be provided the \"Question\", the \"Answer\", the \"DiagramType\" and the \"DiagramTypeDocs\"\nYour output will be parsed and validate so you must reply with VALID mermaidJS code only and in the following format:\n```mermaid\n{ diagram }\n```\n\nPrefer diagrams with simple syntax\nAvoid styling on the diagram\nEscape characters when needed\nMake sure that you don't use any forbidden mermaid characters\nMake sure to below the instructions and examples in the syntax documentation\nYou MUST produce valid mermaidJS syntax!\n",
        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\n public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        method(1);\n    }\n    static void method(int n){\n/*\n        System.out.println(n);\n        method(n+1);// we are not mentioning any limit in this logic, So it prints infinitely till the Stackoverflow error occurs\n*/\n        if (n==5){\n            System.out.println(5);\n            return;\n        }  // this block of code is the \"Base condition\"..\n        System.out.println(n);\n        method(n+1); // calling itself --RECURSION\n    }\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\n```java\n- The `main` method calls the `method` with an initial value of 1.\n- The `method` method takes an integer `n` as a parameter.\n- Inside the `method` method:\n    - If `n` is equal to 5, it prints 5 and then returns, acting as the base condition to stop the recursion.\n    - If `n` is not equal to 5, it prints the current value of `n` and then recursively calls itself with `n+1`.\n    - This recursive call continues until `n` reaches 5, at which point it stops.\n- The commented-out code block before the base condition would cause an infinite recursion leading to a `StackOverflowError`.\n```\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: A sequence diagram is the most suitable for this scenario because it excellently represents the sequence of operations, including method calls and recursion. It can visually depict the order in which methods are called and how the recursion unfolds until the base condition is met. This is particularly useful for understanding the flow of execution and the interaction between the `main` method and the `method` method over time.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

It's very affordable and covers all essential data structures like the array, linked list, binary tree, hash table, stack, queue, and others.  How to check if an array contains a given value in Java?   To give you some more idea of the problem, let's see an example first; suppose you have a String[] with values like so:  public static final String[] names = new String[] {\"Java\",\"JEE\",\"Scala\",\"C++\"}; Given the String name, you need to return true or false, depending upon whether names contain that value or not. By the way, here is a full example of how to search a number on an integer array and searching for a name on String array, in case you need any help.

The first method uses contains() method of ArrayList by first converting given an array to ArrayList, while the second method simply uses a linear search algorithm to search on a Java array.  By the way, to make the question more challenging, I usually asked the candidate to\u00a0write a parametric method using generic\u00a0so that it will work for any type of object array in Java. If you are interested, you can try solving that version as well.  In case, if you are not familiar with Generics and writing Parametric class and methods in Java then I suggest you join a comprehensive Java course like  The Complete Java Masterclass on Udemy to learn Generics better.

A sequence diagram is suitable for illustrating how these operations interact over time, showing the flow from the start of the program to the conclusion of the search operation.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page.

To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

It can illustrate the interactions between different entities (such as the user, the repository, and any integrated services) over time, showing the sequence of operations that occur when someone interacts with the repo. This type of diagram effectively communicates the dynamic behavior and flow of control among the components involved in the repository's operation.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page.

For this tutorial, we're going with the default type for authenticator in otplib which is totp. {app} is the name of the app this 2FA is for. It will appear in the user's app after they scan the code. {accountName} is their email in the app. {secret} is the secret you generated earlier. You can also pass additional query parameters in the place of {query} to customize the authentication. For example, you can change the number of digits of the TOTP codes from 6 to 8 using the query parameter &digits=8. authenticator has the method keyuri which accepts an email (accountName), the app's name (app), and the secret (secret) as parameters."

Certifique-se de estudar mais a fundo as bibliotecas mencionadas e adaptar o c\u00f3digo conforme necess\u00e1rio para atender aos requisitos espec\u00edficos do seu projeto.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: A escolha do diagrama de sequ\u00eancia \u00e9 devido ao processo passo a passo descrito para implementar a autentica\u00e7\u00e3o de dois fatores (2FA) em Node.js. Este processo envolve v\u00e1rias etapas e intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre componentes (como a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de uma chave secreta, gera\u00e7\u00e3o de um c\u00f3digo QR, e valida\u00e7\u00e3o do c\u00f3digo OTP), o que se alinha bem com a natureza de um diagrama de sequ\u00eancia que mostra como os processos operam uns com os outros e em que ordem.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

It utilizes Django signals and webhook integration for real-time monitoring of model changes.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The provided code snippet outlines a sequence of operations involving function calls and interactions between different components (such as sending messages via webhooks, generating webhook URLs, and tracking product changes). A sequence diagram is most suitable for representing these interactions over time, showing how processes operate with one another and in what order. It effectively captures the flow of control and data among the system components involved in the scenario, making it the appropriate choice for visualizing the described operations.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

The `send_message_via_webhook` function expects only the `message_text` argument, but in the code, it is being called with two arguments (`webhook_url` and `message_text`).\n\n### Solution:\nTo fix the issue, you need to modify the call to `send_message_via_webhook` to only pass the `message_text` as an argument. Here's the corrected line of code:\n\n```python\nsend_message_via_webhook(message_text)\n```\n\nBy making this change, the `send_message_via_webhook` function will be called correctly with the expected single argument, resolving the issue in the code.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation and the provided code snippet describe a sequence of operations that occur, including function calls and conditional checks. A sequence diagram is best suited to represent the order of operations and the interaction between different parts of the system, such as function calls and responses. It can effectively illustrate the flow from the `track_product_changes` function to the `send_message_via_webhook` function, including the decision-making process based on the condition checks. This makes the sequence diagram the most appropriate choice for visualizing the described scenario.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

        "answer": "The error `AttributeError: '_AsyncGeneratorContextManager' object has no attribute 'exec'` is likely occurring because the `session` object does not have an `exec` method. In the provided code snippet, it seems like you are trying to execute a SQL query using `session.exec(statement)`, but the `exec` method is not a standard method for a session object.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can use the `execute` method instead of `exec` to execute the SQL query. Here's how you can modify the `startup` function:\n\n```python\nasync def startup(session):\n    statement = select(Product).where(Product.name == \"access_management\")\n    result = await session.execute(statement)\n    if not result.unique().all():\n        am_product = Product(product_type=\"APPLICATION\", name=\"access_management\", description=\"Access Management\")\n        session.add(am_product)\n        await session.commit()\n```\n\nBy replacing `session.exec(statement)` with `session.execute(statement)`, you should be able to execute the SQL query correctly.",

Many Python developers believe these problems are not possible with coroutines in asyncio. The reason is that only one coroutine can run within the event loop at any one time. It is true that only one coroutine can run at a time. The problem is, coroutines can suspend and resume and may do so while using a shared resource or shared variable. Without protecting critical sections, race conditions can occur in asyncio programs."

In the provided code snippet, it seems like you are trying to execute a SQL query using `session.exec(statement)`, but the `exec` method is not a standard method for a session object.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can use the `execute` method instead of `exec` to execute the SQL query. Here's how you can modify the `startup` function:\n\n```python\nasync def startup(session):\n    statement = select(Product).where(Product.name == \"access_management\")\n    result = await session.execute(statement)\n    if not result.unique().all():\n        am_product = Product(product_type=\"APPLICATION\", name=\"access_management\", description=\"Access Management\")\n        session.add(am_product)\n        await session.commit()\n```\n\nBy replacing `session.exec(statement)` with `session.execute(statement)`, you should be able to execute the SQL query correctly.\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The explanation provided involves the interaction between different components (such as the session object and the database) and the order in which these interactions occur (e.g., executing a SQL statement, checking results, and possibly adding a new product to the database). A sequence diagram is ideal for illustrating these interactions and the sequence of operations, making it easier to understand the flow of the application and how the error can be resolved by changing the method call from 'exec' to 'execute'.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

Hidden to insert your code in one of three specific locations: Head for the site's <head> element, Body Top for just after the site's opening <body> tag, or Body End for just before the site's closing </body> tag. Since this effectively publishes the embed outside the normal element flow, feel free to move it somewhere more convenient (to the very end of the site, for example). You're done!"

A sequence diagram is best suited to represent the order of these operations and interactions, especially between the web page and the embedded iframe content, highlighting the sequence of script execution and interaction with external resources.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

        "prompt": "# Question - Question from the user\nMax Score: 200\n\nLook at the following sequence:\n\n3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 17, 18, 20....\n\nAll the numbers in the series have exactly 2 bits set in their binary representation. Your task is simple, you have to find the Nth number of this sequence.\n\n\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. It's followed by T lines, each containing a single number N.\n\n\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, print the Nth number of the sequence, separated by a newline. Since the number can be very large, print the number % 1000000007.\n\n\n\nConstraints\n\n30 points\n\n1 <= T, N <= 200\n\n\n\n70 points\n\n1 <= T, N <= 105\n\n\n\n100 points\n\n1 <= T <= 105\n\n1 <= N <= 1014\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5\n\n50\n\n100\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n3\n\n5\n\n10\n\n1040\n\n16640 in python\n\n# Answer - Answer given to the user\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ndef findNthNumber(T, numbers):\n    def countSetBits(n):\n        count = 0\n        while n:\n            count += n & 1\n            n >>= 1\n        return count\n\n    def findNth(N):\n        count = 0\n        num = 0\n        while count < N:\n            num += 1\n            if countSetBits(num) == 2:\n                count += 1\n        return num % MOD\n\n    results = []\n    for i in range(T):\n        results.append(findNth(numbers[i]))\n    \n    return results\n```\n\n# DiagramType - Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The provided solution involves a sequence of operations that occur between different functions and loops to compute the Nth number in the given sequence. A sequence diagram is best suited to represent the flow of messages, method calls, and the order of execution between objects or functions in this scenario. It can effectively illustrate how the 'findNthNumber' function interacts with 'findNth' and 'countSetBits', and how these interactions lead to the final result for each test case.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",

        "answer": "### Explanation of the Code:\n- The `App` component is a functional component in React.\n- It utilizes React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect` for managing state and side effects.\n- It fetches comments data from a local server at `http://localhost:8000/comments` using the `fetch` API inside the `useEffect` hook.\n- The component renders a list of comments and their replies.\n- It contains functions to handle replying to comments, adding new replies, and deleting comments.\n- It uses various child components like `Counter`, `Header`, `Content`, and `ReplyForm` to display the comments and replies.\n- The `handleReply` function sets the `selectedReplyId` state to the id of the comment being replied to.\n- The `addNewReplies` function adds a new reply to a comment and updates the state accordingly.\n- The `handleDeleteComments` function removes a comment based on its id from the data.\n- The component conditionally renders a reply form when replying to a comment or its reply.\n- It also conditionally renders the replies to a comment.\n- The `ReplyForm` component is used to add new replies with the specified content.\n- The `Counter`, `Header`, and `Content` components are used to display the score, user information, and content of comments and replies.\n- The `image` prop in the `Header` component is accessed using `comment.user.image.png`.\n- The `image` prop in the `Header` component for replies has a fallback value of `\"./images/avatars/image-juliusomo.png\"` if not present in the reply data.\n- The `username` prop in the `Header` component for replies has a fallback value of `\"juliusomo\"` if not present in the reply data.\n\n### Note:\n- The code snippet provided is a React component that handles comments and replies functionality.\n- It fetches comment data from a local server, allows users to reply to comments, add new replies, and delete comments.\n- The component structure involves rendering comments, replies, and reply forms based on user interactions.\n- It uses various child components to display different parts of the comments and replies.",

Diagram type that you must use and why it was chosen\nDiagram Type: sequenceDiagram\nReasoning: The provided code snippet describes the interactions between various components and functions within a React application, specifically focusing on fetching data, handling user interactions like replying to comments, adding new replies, and deleting comments. A sequence diagram is most appropriate here as it can effectively illustrate the order of operations and interactions between components and functions over time, such as the sequence of events triggered by user actions or lifecycle methods in the React component.\n\n# DiagramTypeDocs - Syntax documentation to build the diagram\n\n> A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\n\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\n    John-->>Alice: Great!\n    Alice-)John: See you later!\n```\n\n```note\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\n\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\n```\n\n## Syntax\n\n### Participants\n\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are\nrendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a\ndifferent order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of\nappearance by doing the following:\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Actors\n\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor Alice\n    actor Bob\n    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n### Aliases\n\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Alice\n    participant J as John\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n```\n\n### Actor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+)\n\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\n\n```\ncreate participant B\nA --> B: Hello\n```\n\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\n\n```mermaid-example\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ?\n    Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you?\n    create participant Carl\n    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!\n    create actor D as Donald\n    Carl->>D: Hi!\n    destroy Carl\n    Alice-xCarl: We are too many\n    destroy Bob\n    Bob->>Alice: I agree\n```\n\n#### Unfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error\n\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\n\n> The destroyed participant **participant-name** does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\n\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\n\n### Grouping / Box\n\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\n\n```\nbox Aqua Group Description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox Group without description\n... actors ...\nend\nbox rgb(33,66,99)\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```note\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\n```\n\n```\nbox transparent Aqua\n... actors ...\nend\n```\n\n```mermaid-example\n    sequenceDiagram\n    box Purple Alice & John\n    participant A\n    participant J\n    end\n    box Another Group\n    participant B\n    participant C\n    end\n    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?\n    J->>A: Great!\n    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley?\n    B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you?\n```\n\n\n# Your output",
