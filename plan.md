# Goals of this project
- Get 100% correct syntax on generated diagrams
- Improve quality of diagrams

# Plan
- ‚úÖ Generate dataset for training
  - ‚úÖ Use dataset that was provided and filter questions that are programming related (using GPT)
  - ‚úÖ Ask GPT to choose the appropriate diagram type for the each answer
  - ‚úÖ Ask GPT to generate the diagram based on the diagram type and its documentation
  - ‚úÖ Evaluate output for valid syntax, if incorrect, repeat
  - üïö (for later) Further refine the answer to improve quality and syntax
    - feed the validation error back to gpt to fix
    - provide better documentation or more examples of valid syntax
    - instruct the model to simplify the syntax
    - Ask GPT to evaluate the diagram
    - Ask GPT to generate a description of a diagram and have a model just creating the syntax‚ùó
- ‚úÖ Generate dataset for fine-tuning an openAI model
  - Include in prompt:
    - Diagram type
    - question and answer context
    - Diagram type documentation (should we include the docs or not? - probably not) (ok to have the docs if in inference we don't need to send the docs)
- Evaluate performance of fine-tuned model:
  - Check for syntax validity (how many failed attempts with GPT-4 vs with fine-tuned model?)
  - Test performance of models with and without the documentation in the prompt
  - Ask GPT-4 to evaluate a subset
  - Choose random scenarios and document a subjective comparison between results of both models

- Try and compare different approaches
  - Fine-tune an OSS model like mistral or other models that are good with code


New Idea: manually fix the failed generations and add those examples to the dataset. That should allow gpt to fine-tune on corner cases


# Round 2

Based on the experience and feedback I need to improve the following:
- Dataset needs to be bigger
  - I can try to create a parser/fixer to transform failed generations on the original dataset into valid diagrams that can be used for training
- Training and Testing dataset MUST be separated
- The examples on the dataset need to be heterogeneous (may not be needed if we get consistent results on random tests)
- Ask model to output diagrams without markdown
- After the first results, make a report on frequent errors found: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1365nJgl0dLyo8gzXpi_P_2U-TsIPezsa8FY6t9XrJYI/edit?pli=1

Goal: 89 to 91%
